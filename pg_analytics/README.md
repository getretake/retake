# Important Notice

`pg_analytics` and `pg_lakehouse` have been combined into a single extension, `pg_analytics`, which has been moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics) to facilitate community contributions and adoption. The extension still ships as part of ParadeDB, and this README is maintained for visibility.
