# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
# The '*' pattern is global owners.
# Global rule:
*                                                              @rebasedming @philippemnoel @mauaraujo

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

/.github/                                                      @philippemnoel
/assets/                                                       @philippemnoel
/connectors/                                                   @rebasedming
/core/                                                         @rebasedming
/docs/                                                         @rebasedming
/retake/                                                       @rebasedming
/streams/                                                      @rebasedming


# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.
