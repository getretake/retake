# ParadeDB Benchmarks

The ParadeDB benchmarks are split into:

- [Search - pg_bm25](pg_bm25/benchmarks/README.md)
- [Analytics - pg_analytics](pg_analytics/README.md)

Please see the relevant subfolder for the benchmarks you are interested in.

In the future, we'll be adding benchmarks for workloads intersecting both search and analytics. If there's anything specific you'd like to see, please open a GitHub issue or come chat with us in the [ParadeDB Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/paradedbcommunity/shared_invite/zt-217mordsh-ielS6BiZf7VW3rqKBFgAlQ).
