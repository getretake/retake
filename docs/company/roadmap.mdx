The goal of this page is to provide transparency into what we're working on, what we've completed, and to align
the efforts of the core Retake team with community efforts.

### Upcoming Features

Below is a list of high-priority features that the Retake team is working on right now.

- Add MySQL `Source` connections
- Add NoSQL `Source` connections like MongoDB, Firebase, and AWS S3
- Add additional embedding models like Cohere, Instructor embeddings, and Google PaLM
- Add OpenSearch and Algolia `Sink` connections
- Add more vector database `Sink` connections: Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant, etc.
- Build a robust test suite
- Bringing the real-time update server up to production
- Support self-hosted AWS deployment capabilities

### Completed Features

A list of features that have been completed

**July 16, 2023: Weaviate Connector**: Support for Weaviate sinks added.

**July 13, 2023: First MVP of Real-Time Server**: First MVP of the real-time server between Postgres and ElasticSearch working in a local Docker environment.

**July 11, 2023: More Embedding Models**: Introducing a wrapper for the Cohere embedding model and support for custom embedding functions.

**July 10, 2023: Pinecone Connector**: Support for Pinecone sinks added.

**July 6, 2023: First MVP**: We're excited to release our first MVP into the wild! It's very bare-boned: just one connector between Postgres and ElasticSearch. Has only been tested on a local machine,
and only batch updates are working (we're putting on the afterburners to add real-time vector data streams over the weekend).
