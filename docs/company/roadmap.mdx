**July 6, 2023: First MVP**

We're excited to release our first MVP into the wild!

It's very bare-boned: just one connector between Postgres and ElasticSearch. Has only been tested on a local machine,
and only batch updates are working (we're putting on the afterburners to add real-time vector data streams over the weekend).
