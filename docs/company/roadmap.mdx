The goal of this page is to provide transparency into what we're working on, what we've completed, and to align
the efforts of the core Retake team with community efforts.

## Upcoming Features

Below is a list of high-priority features that the Retake team is working on right now.

- Enable Retake to be deployed to production via Docker Compose or Helm
- Modify the Python client to allow developers to add multiple tables to a single search index
- Build high-level client libraries for Typescript, Java, and Go
- Bring real-time data sync to production (currently a feature branch)
- Build a robust test suite
- Build a managed cloud version

## Requesting a Feature

The best way to request a feature is to [create a Github issue](https://github.com/getretake/retake/issues/new/choose)

**July 25, 2023: First MVP**: We're excited to release our first MVP into the wild! It's very simple: just a Python SDK
with two functions: one to index a Postgres table, and another to execute search queries with the full expressiveness
of the Open/ElasticSearch DSL. We also built an example Python Flask app using our Python library and search engine.
