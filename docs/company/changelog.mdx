**Search Across Multiple Tables**

After talking to our first few users, we realized that we needed to enable
search across multiple tables (for instance, tables connected by a JOIN statement). We have modified the Python client
so that developers can connect multiple tables to a single search index.

**Working Search MVP**

We're excited to release our first MVP into the wild! It's very simple: just a Python SDK
with two functions: one to index a Postgres table, and another to execute search queries with the full expressiveness
of the Open/ElasticSearch DSL. We also built an example Python Flask app using our Python library and search engine.
