<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS account, is coming soon. Please fill out the [interest

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, Azure Postgres, and others. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up logical replication, also known as streaming replication, from a primary Postgres instance (e.g. AWS RDS) to a ParadeDB deployment.
