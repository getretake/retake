<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS account, is coming soon. Please fill out the [interest

<Info>
  This page is for configuring logical replication from an Azure Managed
  Postgres database like Azure Database for PostgreSQL or Azure CosmosDB for
  PostgreSQL into a ParadeDB deployment.
</Info>

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, Azure Postgres, and others. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Azure provides a [comprehensive tutorial for configuring logical replication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical) between an Azure
Database for PostgreSQL database and a subscriber. To configure logical replication between your Azure database and your ParadeDB deployment, follow the instructions for
**Native Logical Replication** with your Azure Database for PostgreSQL database as the **publisher** and your ParadeDB deployment as the **subscriber**.

That's it! Your ParadeDB deploy will now stay in near real-time synchronization with your primary PostgreSQL database.

## Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

Unfortuntely, Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL [does not support logical replication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1193391/does-azure-cosmos-db-for-postgresql-support-logica).
