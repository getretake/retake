<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS account, is coming soon. Please fill out the [interest

<Info>
  This page is for configuring logical replication from a GCP Managed Postgres
  database like GCP CloudSQL for PostgreSQL or AlloyDB for PostgreSQL into a
  ParadeDB deployment.
</Info>

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, Azure Postgres, and others. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

## GCP CloudSQL for PostgreSQL

GCP provides a [comprehensive tutorial for configuring logical replication](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/configure-logical-replication#set-up-native-postgresql-logical-replication) between
a GCP CloudSQL for PostgreSQL database and a subscriber. To configure logical replication between your GCP database and your ParadeDB deployment, follow the instructions for **Set up native PostgreSQL logical replication**
with your GCP CloudSQL for PostgreSQL database as the **publisher** and your ParadeDB deployment as the **subscriber**.

That's it! Your ParadeDB deploy will now stay in near real-time synchronization with your primary PostgreSQL database.

## AlloyDB for PostgreSQL

GCP provides a [comprehensive tutorial for configuring logical replication](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/omni/replicate-data-omni-other-db) between an AlloyDB for PostgreSQL database
and a subscriber. To configure logical replication between your GCP database and your ParadeDB deployment, follow the instructions with your AlloyDB for PostgreSQL database as the _publisher_
and your ParadeDB deployment as the _subscriber_.

That's it! Your ParadeDB deploy will now stay in near real-time synchronization with your primary PostgreSQL database.
