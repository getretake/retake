<Info>
  This page is for configuring logical replication from an AWS Managed Postgres
  database like AWS RDS for PostgreSQL or AWS Aurora for PostgreSQL into a
  ParadeDB deployment.
</Info>

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, Azure Postgres, and others. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

## AWS RDS/Aurora for PostgreSQL

AWS provides a [comprehensive tutorial for configuring logical replication](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-logical-replication-to-replicate-managed-amazon-rds-for-postgresql-and-amazon-aurora-to-self-managed-postgresql/) between an AWS
RDS/Aurora for PostgreSQL database and a subscriber. To configure logical replication between your AWS database and your ParadeDB deployment, follow the instructions with your AWS RDS/Aurora for PostgreSQL database as the **publisher** and your
ParadeDB deployment as the **subscriber**.

That's it! Your ParadeDB deploy will now stay in near real-time synchronization with your primary PostgreSQL database.
