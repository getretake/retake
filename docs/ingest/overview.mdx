Today, a vast amount of data is stored in

1. **Databases** like Postgres
2. **Data lakes** like S3 or GCS
3. **File formats** like Parquet or CSV
4. **Table formats** like Delta Lake or Iceberg

Ingesting this data into ParadeDB with data processing engines or ETL tools is complex and error-prone.
ParadeDB makes it easy to consume this data using nothing but Postgres utilities.
