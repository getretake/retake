ParadeDB is designed to seamlessly ingest data without the need for ETL pipelines. Our users ingest from two primary locations:

## Existing Postgres Databases

ParadeDB can easily ingest operational data from existing Postgres databases, including from managed Postgres services like AWS RDS, using nothing but built-in Postgres utilities.

## Data Lakes

ParadeDB can easily ingest larger, less-frequently updated data stored in common file and open table formats from data lakes like Amazon S3. The ParadeDB ingest API is powered by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org),
an in-process analytical query engine, which also enables running fast analytical queries over data lakes from ParadeDB.
