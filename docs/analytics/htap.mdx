title: Hybrid Queries
---

Hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) is possible with `pg_analytics` through the use of joins between heap and `parquet` tables. Joins between heap and `parquet` tables are as feature-complete as their heap-only and `parquet`-only counterparts, constrained only by any mentioned limitations on `parquet` tables.

## Parquet-Heap Joins

```sql
-- Create heap table
CREATE TABLE transaction (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id BIGINT, description TEXT);
INSERT INTO transaction (user_id, description) VALUES (1, 'transaction one'), (2, 'transaction two'), (4, 'transaction three');

-- Create parquet table
CREATE TABLE log (transaction_id BIGINT, created_at DATE, contents TEXT);
INSERT INTO log VALUES (1, '2024-01-02', 'transaction one started'), (1, '2024-01-03', 'transaction one finished'), (2, '2024-03-03', 'transaction two failed'), (3, '2024-04-03', 'transaction three started');

-- Join heap and parquet tables
SELECT * FROM transaction JOIN log
ON transaction.id = log.transaction_id;
```
