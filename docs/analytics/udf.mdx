title: User-Defined Functions
---

Postgres user-defined functions (UDFs) work the same way on `parquet` tables, with some limitations.

* Overloaded functions do not work on `parquet` tables.
* Constants must be explicitly typed. For example, if we defined a UDF `add(int, int)` and executed the query `SELECT add(1, a) FROM t`, we may see an error like this one:
```
ERROR:  type_coercion
caused by
Error during planning: Coercion from [Utf8, Int64, Int32] to the signature Exact([Utf8, Int32, Int32]) failed.
```
Instead, you should execute the query like so: `SELECT add(1::int, a) FROM t` to avoid the coercion error.

Additionally, user-defined aggregates and types are not yet supported.
