## Overview

Regular Postgres tables, known as heap tables, organize data by row. While this makes sense for operational data,
it is inefficient for analytical queries, which often scan a large amount of data from a subset of the columns
in a table. As a result, ParadeDB introduces special tables called `deltalake` tables. These tables use a
column-oriented layout via Apache Arrow and Parquet and leverage Apache Datafusion, a query engine optimized for column-oriented data.

## Initialize the Context

To enable accelerated analytical processing, the following procedure must be run at the start of every
connection.

```sql
CALL paradedb.init();
```

If tables are created or modified in other connections, this procedure must be re-run for the changes to be
received by the current connection.

## Create a Deltalake Table

`deltalake` tables are custom tables that behave like regular Postgres tables but are designed for
fast analytical processing.

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (name text, rating int) USING deltalake;

INSERT INTO movies VALUES ('Star Wars', 9), ('Indiana Jones', 8);
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies;

DROP TABLE movies;
```

That's it! `deltalake` tables accept regular Postgres queries, so there's nothing new to learn.
