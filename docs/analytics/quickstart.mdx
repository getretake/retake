## Overview

Regular Postgres tables, known as heap tables, organize data by row. While this makes sense for operational data,
it is inefficient for analytical queries, which often scan a large amount of data from a subset of the columns
in a table.

ParadeDB introduces special tables called `deltalake` tables. These tables behave like regular Postgres tables but
use a column-oriented layout via Apache Arrow and Parquet and leverage Apache DataFusion, a query engine
optimized for column-oriented data.

## Using Deltalake Tables

```sql
-- USING deltalake must be provided
CREATE TABLE movies (name text, rating int) USING deltalake;

INSERT INTO movies VALUES ('Star Wars', 9), ('Indiana Jones', 8);
SELECT AVG(rating) FROM movies;

DROP TABLE movies;
```

That's it! `deltalake` tables accept standard Postgres queries, so there's nothing new to learn.

## Copying into a Deltalake Table

This example demonstrates how to copy data from an existing heap table into a `deltalake` table.

```sql
-- Create heap table
CREATE TABLE heap (a int, b int);
INSERT INTO heap VALUES (1, 2);

-- Create deltalake table with the same schema
CREATE TABLE delta (a int, b int) USING deltalake;

-- Copy data into deltalake table
INSERT INTO delta SELECT * FROM heap;
```

## Use Cases

`deltalake` tables have two primary advantages over regular tables:

1. Significantly faster aggregate queries
2. Lower disk space, since data is stored as highly-compressed Parquet files

They should be used for storing and querying large volumes of event or analytics data.

## Non Use Cases

Regular Postgres tables should be used for operational data that requires frequent updates
or deletes.

## Known Limitations

`deltalake` tables are currently in beta. The following is a list of known limitations. Many of these
will become resolved as `deltalake` tables become production-ready.

- [ ] `UPDATE` statements
- [ ] Nested `DELETE` statements
- [ ] Partitioning tables by column
- [ ] Some Postgres types like arrays, JSON, time, and timestamp with time zone
- [ ] User-defined functions, aggregations, or types
- [ ] Referencing `deltalake` and regular Postgres `heap` tables in the same query
- [ ] Write-ahead-log (WAL) support and `ROLLBACK`
- [ ] Foreign keys
- [ ] Index scans
- [ ] `TEMP` tables
- [ ] Using an external data lake as a table storage provider
- [ ] Full text search over `deltalake` tables with `pg_bm25`
