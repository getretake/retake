## Physical Backups

`parquet` tables can be physically replicated using `pg_dump`:

```bash
pg_dump -U <username> -d <database> -h <host> -p <port> > <file_name>.sql
```

This command will create a `.sql` file containing the schema and contents of your entire database.

## Logical Replication

Logical replication of `parquet` tables is not yet supported.
