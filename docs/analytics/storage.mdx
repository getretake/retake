title: Storage Optimization

### Vacuums

When `parquet` tables are dropped, they remain on disk until `VACUUM` is run. This operation physically
deletes the Parquet files of dropped tables.

The `VACUUM FULL <table_name>` command is used to optimize a table's storage by bin-packing small Parquet
files into larger files, which can significantly improve query time and compression. It also deletes
Parquet files belonging to dropped data.

### Partitions

By default, Parquet files are partitioned by file size. The maximum file size of each partition is 100MB.

Custom partitioning strategies, like column-based partioning, are a commercial feature that can enhance
query performance and storage efficiency. Please contact us [here](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).
