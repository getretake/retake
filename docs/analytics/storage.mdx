title: Storage Optimization
---

When `parquet` tables are dropped, they remain on disk until `VACUUM` is run. This operation physically
deletes the Parquet files of dropped tables.

The `VACUUM FULL <table_name>` command is used to optimize a table's storage by bin-packing small Parquet
files into larger files, which can significantly improve query time and compression. It also deletes
Parquet files belonging to dropped data.
