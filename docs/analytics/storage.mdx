title: Storage Optimization
---

### Vacuums

The `VACUUM FULL <table_name>` command is used to optimize a table's storage by bin-packing small Parquet
files into larger files, which can significantly improve query time and compression.

### Partitions

By default, Parquet files are partitioned by file size. The maximum file size of each partition is 100MB.

Custom partitioning strategies, like column-based partioning, are a commercial feature that can enhance
query performance and storage efficiency. Please contact us [here](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).
