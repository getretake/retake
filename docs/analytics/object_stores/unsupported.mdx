title: Other Object Stores
---

ParadeDB uses [Apache OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/opendal) to integrate with object stores. This makes it
straightforward to add support for object stores like Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, MongoDB, etc.

Supporting all of OpenDAL's object stores is on the roadmap. To request prioritization for a specific object
store, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/issues).
