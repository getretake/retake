title: Other Object Stores
---

ParadeDB uses [Apache OpenDAL](https://github.com/apache/opendal) to integrate with object stores. This makes it
straightforward to add support for many other object stores.

Supporting all of OpenDAL's object stores is on the roadmap. To request prioritization for a specific object
store, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/issues).
