<Note>
  Retake also supports search over non-Postgres data sources. If you do not wish
  to integrate with Postgres, you may skip this section.
</Note>
<Info>**Prerequisite** Make sure you are running PostgreSQL 11 or higher.</Info>

Retake leverages PostgreSQL [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) to
detect changes in the database and propagate them to Retake.

## Enable Logical Replication

### Non-AWS

1. Ensure Postgres database user is a superuser

```
SELECT usename FROM pg_user WHERE usesuper = true
```

2. Enable logical decoding in `postgres.conf`

```
wal_level = logical
```

3. Add replication slots. You must have at least as many replication slots as the number of tables you wish to
   search over.

```
max_replication_slots = 10
```

### AWS

Enable logical replication by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html).
