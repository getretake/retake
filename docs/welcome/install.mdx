title: Install ParadeDB
---

The fastest way to install ParadeDB is by pulling the ParadeDB docker image and running it locally.

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may set `user`, `password`, and `dbname` to whatever values you want â€” these will be your database
connection credentials. By default, this will start a ParadeDB instance at `http://localhost:5432`.

To connect to ParadeDB, install the `psql` client and run

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p <port> -W
```

<Note>
Because all of ParadeDB's features are packaged as Postgres extensions, you can alternatively install ParadeDB
by [downloading the extensions](/deploy/pg_search) into an existing self-managed Postgres database.

That's it! Next, let's [run a few queries](/welcome/quickstart) over mock data with ParadeDB.
