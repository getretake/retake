title: Install ParadeDB
---

The fastest way to install ParadeDB is by pulling the ParadeDB docker image and running it locally.

```bash
docker run \
  --name paradedb \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase \
  -v paradedb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/ \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

You may replace `myuser`, `mypassword`, and `mydatabase` with whatever values you want â€” these will be your database
connection credentials. By default, this will start a ParadeDB instance at `http://localhost:5432`.

To connect to ParadeDB, install the `psql` client and run

```bash
docker exec -it paradedb psql -U myuser -d mydatabase -W
```

<Note>
  Because all of ParadeDB's features are packaged as Postgres extensions, you
  can alternatively install ParadeDB by [downloading the
  extensions](/deploy/pg_search) into an existing self-managed Postgres
  database.

That's it! Next, let's [run a few queries](/welcome/quickstart) over mock data with ParadeDB.
