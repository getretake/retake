## Custom Ordering

`@@@` does not perform any sorting on the result set. In particular, it does not compute or sort by BM25 score. [`score_bm25`](/documentation/full-text/scoring) should be used for that.

To order the result set by a field, `ORDER BY` should be used.

```sql
SELECT description, rating FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes'
ORDER BY rating;
```

The order can either be `ASC` or `DESC`. The default order is `ASC`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
