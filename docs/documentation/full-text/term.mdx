title: Term Search
---

## Basic Usage

Searches for the presence of a specific [term](/documentation/concepts/term).

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

If the provided term can be tokenized further, the tokenization is automatically applied at search time using the same tokenizer
as the prefixed field.

## Multiple Terms

`AND` and `OR` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard' OR category @@@ 'toy';
```

If multiple terms are passed into the same query string, they are `OR`ed together by default.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'keyboard headphones';
```

## Not Term

`-` omits results that contain a specific term. The following query finds documents that match
`shoes` or `running` but not `white`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ '(shoes running -white)';
```

## Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, ```, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE` must be escaped by a`\` inside the query term.
