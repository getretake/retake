title: Boosting
---

## Basic Usage

The `^` operator is used to boost the scores of individual fields. Boosting is helpful for tuning
the relevance scores of results. In the following query, `category` is weighted twice as heavily as `description`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes OR category:electronics^2');
```
