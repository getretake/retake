## Order by Relevance

The `score` column returned by [`paradedb.score`](/documentation/full-text/scoring) can be used to sort results by
BM25 relevance.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Order by Field

The result set can be ordered by any field in `ASC` or `DESC` order. By default, Postgres orders by `ASC`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

When sorting by a field and a limit indexed as `fast => true`, ParadeDB will efficiently return the "top N" fields
sorted by that field. This is true for all numeric fields (including dates) along with text fields that use the
`normalizer = 'raw'` setting.

If the field is a text field defined as `fast => true, normalizer => 'lowercase'` (ParadeDB's default for "text" fields),
then the query can be ordered by `lower(field)` for efficient "top N" results sorted by the lowercase version of the
field.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY lower(category) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Tiebreaking

Postgres can `ORDER BY` multiple columns to break ties in BM25 scores. In the following query, rows with the same
`score` will be sorted by `rating` in descending order.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE category @@@ 'electronics'
ORDER BY score DESC, rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
