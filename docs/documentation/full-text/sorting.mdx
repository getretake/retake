## Order by Relevance

The `score` column returned by [`paradedb.score`](/documentation/full-text/scoring) can be ordered on to sort results by
BM25 relevance.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Order by Field

The result set can be ordered by any field in `ASC` or `DESC` order. By default, Postgres orders by `ASC`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Tiebreaking

Postgres can `ORDER BY` multiple columns to break ties in BM25 scores. In the following query, rows with the same
`score` will be sorted by `rating` in descending order.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE category @@@ 'electronics'
ORDER BY score DESC, rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
