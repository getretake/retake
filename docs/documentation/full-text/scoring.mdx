title: BM25 Scoring
---

<Note>
  The `rank_bm25` function has been deprecated as of 0.8.5 and has been replaced
  with `score_bm25`, which follows new query syntax and has a different return type.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

BM25 scores measure how relevant a score is for a given query. Higher scores indicate higher relevance.

The `score_bm25` function takes a query and returns a table with two columns: the `key_field` of each result and its BM25 score. `score_bm25` accepts the same
parameters as [`search`](/documentation/full-text/overview).

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_bm25('description:keyboard');
```

## Joining BM25 Scores

Because `score_bm25` generates a new `score_bm25` column, the function does not return all the columns of the original table.
To map the columns of the original table to the output of `score_bm25`, perform a JOIN on the `key_field` column.

```sql
-- Here, the key_field is "id"
WITH scores AS (
    SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_bm25(
      'description:keyboard',
      limit_rows => 10
    )
)
SELECT scores.id, description, score_bm25
FROM scores
LEFT JOIN mock_items ON scores.id = mock_items.id;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Output">
```csv
 id |       description        | score_bm25
----+--------------------------+------------
  2 | Plastic Keyboard         |  3.2668595
  1 | Ergonomic metal keyboard |  2.8213787
(2 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Score Refresh

Unlike `search`, `score_bm25` bypasses the Postgres index access method and queries the index directly to obtain the BM25 score. As a result, previously-deleted rows may influence the BM25 score.

Running `VACUUM` on the underlying table will remove all dead rows from the index and ensures that only rows visible to the current
transaction are factored into the BM25 score.

```sql
VACUUM <table_name>;
```
