title: BM25 Scoring
---

<Note>
  The `score_bm25` function has been deprecated as of 0.11.0 and has been replaced with `paradedb.score`, which
  offers a cleaner syntax and tighter integrations with the Postgres query planner by projecting scores directly
  onto the result table.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

BM25 scores measure how relevant a score is for a given query. Higher scores indicate higher relevance.
The `paradedb.score(<key_field>)` function can be added to any query where an `@@@` operator is present.

```sql
SELECT id, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
LIMIT 5;
```

## Score Refresh

The scores generated by the BM25 index may be influenced by dead rows that have not been cleaned up by the `VACUUM` process.

Running `VACUUM` on the underlying table will remove all dead rows from the index and ensures that only rows visible to the current
transaction are factored into the BM25 score.

```sql
VACUUM <table_name>;
```
