title: Inspect an Index
---

## Index Schema

`paradedb.schema` returns information about the index schema. This is useful for inspecting how an index was configured.

The following code block inspects an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name quoted in a string.

```sql
SELECT name, field_type FROM paradedb.schema('search_idx');
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
  The index to inspect.
</ParamField>

## Index Size

Because BM25 indexes rely on a custom storage implementation, the built-in Postgres `pg_relation_size` function does not work. Instead, the custom
`paradedb.index_size` function returns the size of a BM25 index in bytes.

The following code block returns the size of an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name quoted in a string.

```sql
SELECT index_size FROM paradedb.index_size('search_idx');
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
  The index to inspect.
</ParamField>

## Index Segments

`paradedb.index_info` returns information about the index's underlying [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment). It is useful for verifying that the number
of segments matches the index's [target segment count](/documentation/configuration/index#target-segment-count).

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.index_info('search_idx');
```
