title: Inspect an Index
---

## Index Schema

`paradedb.schema` returns information about the index schema. This is useful for inspecting how an index was configured.

The following code block inspects an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name quoted in a string.

```sql
SELECT name, field_type FROM paradedb.schema('search_idx');
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
  The index to inspect.
</ParamField>

## Index Size

`pg_relation_size` can be used to inspect the index size. `pg_size_pretty` turns the size from bytes
into a human-readable format.

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('search_idx'));
```

## Index Segments

`paradedb.index_info` returns information about the index's underlying [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment). It is useful for verifying that the number
of segments matches the index's [target segment count](/documentation/configuration/index#target-segment-count).

```sql
SELECT * FROM paradedb.index_info('search_idx');
```
