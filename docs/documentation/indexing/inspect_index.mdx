title: Inspect an Index
---

## Index Schema

The `schema` function returns a table with information about the index schema. This is useful for inspecting how an index was configured.

The following code block inspects an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name quoted in a string.

Note that Postgres index instance includes a `_bm25_index` suffix on the `index_name` passed to `paradedb.create_bm25()`.

```sql
SELECT name, field_type FROM paradedb.schema('search_idx_bm25_index');
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
  The index to inspect.
</ParamField>

## Index Size

Because BM25 indexes rely on a custom storage implementation, the built-in Postgres `pg_relation_size` function does not work. Instead, the custom
`index_size` function returns the size of a BM25 index in bytes.

The following code block returns the size of an index called `search_idx`. The argument should be the index name quoted in a string.

Note that Postgres index instance includes a `_bm25_index` suffix on the `index_name` passed to `paradedb.create_bm25()`.

```sql
SELECT index_size FROM paradedb.index_size('search_idx_bm25_index');
```

<ParamField body="index" required>
  The index to inspect.
</ParamField>
