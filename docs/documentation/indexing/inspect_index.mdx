title: Inspect an Index
---

## Index Schema

The `schema` function returns a table with information about the index schema. This is useful for inspecting how an index was configured.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.schema();
```

## Index Size

Because BM25 indexes rely on a custom storage implementation, the built-in Postgres `pg_relation_size` function does not work. Instead, the custom
`index_size` function returns the size of a BM25 index in bytes.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.index_size();
```
