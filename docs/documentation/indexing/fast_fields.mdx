title: Fast Fields
---

## Basic Usage

A field that is indexed as `fast` is stored in a column-oriented fashion. Fast fields are necessary for
[aggregations/faceting](/documentation/faceting/overview). They can also improve the query times of [filtering](/documentation/full-text/filtering)
and BM25 scoring.

The following code block demonstrates how to specify a fast field.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  numeric_fields => paradedb.field('rating', fast => true)
);
```

## Normalizers

The normalizer controls how text and JSON fast fields are tokenized. By default, the `raw` normalizer is used. It treats the entire text as a single token and removes tokens
larger than 255 bytes. The `lowercase` normalizer is like `raw` but also lowercases the token.

```sql
paradedb.field('category', fast => true, normalizer => 'raw' | 'lowercase')
```
