title: Fast Fields
---

## Basic Usage

A field that is indexed as `fast` is stored in a column-oriented fashion. Fast fields are necessary for
[aggregations/faceting](/documentation/faceting/overview). They can also improve the query times of [filtering](/documentation/full-text/filtering) and
[sorting](/documentation/full-text/sorting).

By default, [numeric](/documentation/indexing/create_index#numeric-fields), [datetime](/documentation/indexing/create_index#datetime-fields), and [boolean](/documentation/indexing/create_index#boolean-fields)
are indexed as fast. The following code block demonstrates how to specify a fast field.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  numeric_fields => paradedb.field('rating', fast => true)
);
```

## Normalizers

The normalizer controls how text fast fields are stored. By default, the `raw` normalizer is used. The `raw` normalizer is useful for accelerating
queries that [sort by the text field](/documentation/full-text/sorting#fast-ordering).

```sql
paradedb.field('category', fast => true, normalizer => 'raw')
```

Setting the normalizer to `lowercase` is useful for queries that [sort by the lowercase text field](/documentation/full-text/sorting#ordering-by-text-field).
