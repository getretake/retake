title: Delete an Index
---

## Basic Usage

The following command deletes a BM25 index, as well as its associated schema and query functions.
It's important to use `paradedb.drop_bm25` instead of `DROP INDEX` to ensure that all index-related resources are cleaned up.

```sql
CALL paradedb.drop_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  schema_name => 'public'
);
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="schema_name" default="CURRENT SCHEMA">
  The name of the schema that the index was created in.
</ParamField>
