title: Partial Index
---

## Basic Usage

The following code block demonstrates how to pass predicates to `create_bm25`
to construct a [partial index](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html). Partial
indexes are useful for reducing index size on disk and improving update speeds over non-indexed rows.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description)
WITH (key_field='id')
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND rating > 2;
```
