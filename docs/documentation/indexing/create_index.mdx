title: Create an Index
---

## Basic Usage

The following code block creates a [BM25 index](/documentation/concepts/index) called `search_idx` over multiple columns of the `mock_items` table.
All columns that are relevant to the search query, including columns used for sorting and filtering, should be indexed for optimal performance.

```sql
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description, category, rating, in_stock, created_at, metadata, weight_range)
WITH (key_field='id');
```

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <schema_name>.<table_name>
USING bm25 (<columns>)
WITH (key_field='<key_field>');
```

<ParamField body="index_name">
  The name of the index being created. If unspecified, Postgres will automatically choose a name.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema that the table belongs to. If unspecified, `CURRENT SCHEMA` is used.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="columns" required>
  A comma-separated list of columns to index, starting with the key field. Text, numeric, datetime, boolean, range, enum, and JSON types can be indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="key_field" required>
  The name of a column in the table that represents a unique identifier for each
  record. Usually, this is the same column that is the primary key of the table.
</ParamField>

## Indexing Settings

Several [settings](/documentation/configuration/index) exist to control the amount of resources to allocate during index creation.  While they have sensible
defaults, overall indexing performance can be drastically improved if configured for the host system.

## Choosing a Key Field

While the key field can be any unique text, numeric, or datetime value, an integer key field will be the most
performant. The Postgres `SERIAL` type is an easy way to create a unique integer column.

Additionally, the key field is not intended to be tokenized. For instance, the following configuration is not allowed:

```sql
-- This will throw an error
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (description)
WITH (key_field = 'description');
```
