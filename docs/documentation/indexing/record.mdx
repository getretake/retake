title: Record

## Basic Usage

The `record` option specifies how much information is recorded with an indexed field. By default, all fields use `position`.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  text_fields => paradedb.field('description', record => 'freq')
);
```

<ParamField body="basic">Records only the document IDs.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="freq">
  Records the document IDs as well as term frequency. This is useful for BM25
  scoring.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="position">
  Records the document ID, term frequency and positions of occurrences. Required
  to run a phrase query.
</ParamField>
