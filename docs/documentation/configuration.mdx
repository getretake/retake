## Custom Scans

ParadeDB uses [custom scans](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/custom-scan.html)
to optimize query execution. By default, custom scans are enabled.

```sql
SET paradedb.enable_custom_scan = true;
```

Custom scans should only be disabled for debugging purposes. They must be enabled for scoring, highlighting,
and various predicate pushdowns to work.

## Indexing Resource Usage

ParadeDB offers a number of `postgresql.conf` settings, which can only be changed by a superuser, to control the number
of concurrent indexing threads and the amount of memory each thread should use.

These settings are split between `CREATE INDEX` and regular `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY` statements as it seems logical that
more resources might be desired for `CREATE INDEX`, which typically only needs to happen once.

### `paradedb.create_index_parallelism`

This is the number of indexing threads to use during `CREATE INDEX`. The default is `8`. A value of zero will
automatically detect "available parallelism" of the host computer.

For best performance it is recommended to use one less than the total number of host computer cores.

This GUC can only be changed by the superuser.

### `paradedb.create_index_memory_budget`

This is the amount of memory to dedicate, **per indexing thread** (see above), before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

It defaults to whatever the Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` is, but can be changed to suit the host system's available
memory. In terms of raw indexing performance, generally larger is better. Keep in mind that this

The value follows Postgres' rules for GUCs that specify byte values. It is measured in megabytes. As such, an
qualified value of `1024` is the same as `1GB`.

This GUC can only be changed by the superuser.

### `paradedb.statement_parallelism`

This is the number of indexing threads to use during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY` statements. The default is `8`. A value of
zero will automatically detect "available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single-record atomic INSERTs or UPDATEs, then a value of `1` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

This GUC can only be changed by the superuser.

### `paradedb.statement_memory_budget`

This is the amount of memory to dedicate, **per indexing thread** (see above), before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

It defaults to whatever the Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` is, but can be changed to suit the host system's available
memory. In terms of raw indexing performance, generally larger is better. Keep in mind that this

The value follows Postgres' rules for GUCs that specify byte values. It is measured in megabytes. As such, an
qualified value of `1024` is the same as `1GB`.

If your typical update patterns are single-record atomic INSERTs or UPDATEs, then a value of `15MB` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

Generally speaking, for statement level indexing, the parallelism value dictates the number of new Tantivy index
segments that will be created, so there's a trade-off between finishing the INSERT/UPDATE statement quickly and the
longer-term search overhead of having many additional index segments until (auto)VACUUM runs.

This GUC can only be changed by the superuser.

### `paradedb.log_create_index_progress`

A boolean setting, defaulting to `false`, which will create Postgres `LOG:` entries every 100,000 rows which include
the indexing rate (rows per second).

This can be useful to monitor the progress of a long-running `CREATE INDEX` statement. The GUC can be changed by
any user.

## Telemetry

By default, ParadeDB collects anonymous telemetry to better understand how many people are
using the open source project. This can be disabled with:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET paradedb.pg_search_telemetry TO 'off';
```
