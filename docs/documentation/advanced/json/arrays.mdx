title: JSON Arrays

## Basic Usage

When dealing with JSON arrays, the array elements are “flattened” so that each element can be searched individually. This means that if a JSON array is encountered, each element in the array is treated as a separate value and indexed accordingly. For example, given the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "colors": ["red", "green", "blue"]
  }
}
```

The JSON array in the colors field is flattened to emit separate terms for each color. This allows for individual search queries like:

```sql
SELECT description, metadata
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.term('metadata.colors:blue')
OR id @@@ paradedb.term('metadata.colors:red');
```
