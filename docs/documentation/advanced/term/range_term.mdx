title: Range Term
---

## Basic Usage

`range_term` filters over `int4range`, `int8range`, `numrange`, `tsrange`, and `tstzrange` [range fields](/documentation/indexing/create_index#range-fields).

The following query finds all ranges that contain a specific value:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.range_term('weight_range', 1);
```

`range_term` can be used with `boolean` queries to "push down" the range filter into the full text search query.

```sql
SELECT id, description, category, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
    must => ARRAY[
        paradedb.range_term('weight_range', 1),
        paradedb.term('category', 'footwear')
    ]
);
```

## Range Comparison

In addition to individual terms, `range_term` can also compare a [Postgres range](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html) against the
range field.

### Intersects

The following query finds all ranges that share at least one common
point with the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.range_term('weight_range', '(10, 12]'::int4range, 'Intersects');
```

### Contains

The following query finds all ranges that are contained by the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.range_term('weight_range', '(3, 9]'::int4range, 'Contains');
```

### Within

The following query finds all ranges that contain the query range:

```sql
SELECT id, weight_range FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.range_term('weight_range', '(2, 11]'::int4range, 'Within');
```
