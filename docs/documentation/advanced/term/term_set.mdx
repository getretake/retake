<Note>
  BM25 scoring is not enabled for term set queries. As a result, the scores
  returned may not be accurate. This behavior reflects the underlying
  implementation in Tantivy.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

Matches documents containing any [term](/documentation/concepts/term) from a specified set.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.term_set(
	terms => ARRAY[
		paradedb.term('description', 'shoes'),
		paradedb.term('description', 'novel')
	]
);
```

<ParamField body="terms" required>
  An `ARRAY` of `paradedb.term` query objects.
</ParamField>
