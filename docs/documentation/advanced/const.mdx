title: Const Score
---

## Basic Usage

Applies a constant score across all documents matched by the underlying query. It can avoid unnecessary score computation on the wrapped query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.const_score(query => paradedb.all(), score => 3.9)
);
```

<ParamField body="score" required>
  The constant score to use for each result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query to perform.
</ParamField>
