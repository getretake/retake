In addition to query strings, the `@@@` operator also accepts query objects, which are generated by query builder
functions. These functions expose nearly all of the query types available in [Tantivy](/documentation/concepts/tantivy).

To use query builder functions, pass the [key field](/documentation/indexing/create_index#choosing-a-key-field) into the left-hand side of the `@@@` operator and the **query object** to the right-hand side.
For instance, the following code block performs a fuzzy term search using the `paradedb.fuzzy_term` query builder function.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.fuzzy_term('description', 'shoez');
```

<Note>
  Unlike the query string syntax, the left-hand side takes a key field instead
  of column name because some query builder functions can span multiple columns.
