## Basic Usage

A boost query wraps around another query to amplify its scoring impact, without altering the set of matched documents.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category, paradedb.score(id)
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
  should => ARRAY[
    paradedb.term('description', 'shoes'),
    paradedb.boost(2.0, paradedb.term('description', 'running'))
  ]
);
```

<ParamField body="boost" required>
  The factor by which to multiply the score of each result.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query to perform.
</ParamField>
