title: Boolean

## Basic Usage

Boolean queries filter documents based on the logical relationships defined by their subqueries, considering:

- Documents that satisfy all `must` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy none of the `must_not` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy at least one condition from either `must` or `should`.

Boolean queries are a powerful way to combine the results of several different queries.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
    should => ARRAY[
      paradedb.term('description', 'headphones')
    ],
    must => ARRAY[
      paradedb.term('category', 'electronics'),
      paradedb.fuzzy_term('description', 'bluetooht')
    ],
    must_not => ARRAY[
      paradedb.range('rating', int4range(NULL, 2, '()'))
    ]
);
```

<ParamField body="must">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="must_not">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must not be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="should">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions of which at least
  one must be matched.
</ParamField>

In order for a boolean query to return a result, one of `must` or `should` must be provided.
`must_not` acts as a mask and does not produce a result set.
