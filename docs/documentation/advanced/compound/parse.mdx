title: Tantivy Query String
---

## Basic Usage

Tantivy comes with its own [string-based query language](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/query/struct.QueryParser.html).

`paradedb.parse` accepts Tantivy query strings, which is useful for concisely expressing complex queries. For instance,
the following two queries are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.parse('description:"running shoes" OR category:footwear')
ORDER BY id;

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(should => ARRAY[
    paradedb.phrase('description', ARRAY['running', 'shoes']),
    paradedb.term('category', 'footwear')
])
ORDER BY id;
```

<Note>
  `paradedb.parse` uses strict syntax parsing, which means that the field name
  must be provided before every query.
