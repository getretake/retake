## Basic Usage

ParadeDB supports aggregates through plain SQL functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`. For instance, the following query tallies the total number of search results for a full text query.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';
```

## Fast Aggregates

<Info>
  Fast aggregates are an enterprise-only feature. [Contact us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Info>

The performance of aggregates over very large result sets (millions of rows or more) is a well-known problem in Postgres.

In ParadeDB enterprise, aggregates over full text search results are drastically accelerated by [fast fields](/documentation/indexing/fast_fields).
Fast fields are stored in a column-oriented fashion, which makes them much quicker to read and process.

You can check which fields are indexed as fast by running `paradedb.schema`.

```sql
SELECT name, fast FROM paradedb.schema('search_idx') ORDER BY fast;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     name     | fast
--------------+------
 metadata     | f
 description  | f
 category     | f
 id           | t
 in_stock     | t
 rating       | t
 weight_range | t
 created_at   | t
 ctid         | t
(9 rows)
```
</Accordion>

In order for a query to be accelerated, **all** of the returned columns must be fast fields. For instance, the following query is accelerated because `rating` is a fast
field, and `COUNT(*)` does not specify any fields.

```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
GROUP BY rating LIMIT 5;
```

You can verify if a query will be accelerated by running `EXPLAIN`. Accelerated queries will show either a `Custom Scan` or `Parallel Index Only Scan` in the query plan.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
GROUP BY rating LIMIT 5;
```

 Limit  (cost=11.53..11.57 rows=2 width=12)
   ->  GroupAggregate  (cost=11.53..11.57 rows=2 width=12)
         Group Key: rating
         ->  Sort  (cost=11.53..11.54 rows=2 width=4)
               Sort Key: rating
               ->  Custom Scan (ParadeDB Scan) on mock_items  (cost=10.00..11.52 rows=2 width=4)
                     Table: mock_items
                     Index: search_idx
                     Fast Fields: rating
                     Scores: false
                     Tantivy Query: {"with_index":{"oid":3567455,"query":{"parse_with_field":{"field":"description","query_string":"shoes","lenient":null,"conjunction_mode":null}}}}
(11 rows)
```
</Accordion>

On the other hand, a query that selects a non-fast field like `description` is not accelerated.

```sql
SELECT description, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
GROUP BY description LIMIT 5;
```

If we run `EXPLAIN` on this query, we'll see a regular `Index Scan`, which indicates that no fast field optimization occurred.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT description, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
GROUP BY description LIMIT 5;
```

## Caveats

In addition to configuring fast fields, there are several other important factors that optimize aggregate performance.

### Predicates

In order for ParadeDB's fast field optimizations to apply, the full text search `@@@` operator must be present and used for all predicates.
For instance, the following two queries produce identical results, but the second query will return faster because only `@@@`, not `=`, is used.

```sql
-- Slow query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes' AND rating = 5;

-- Fast query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.boolean(
  must => ARRAY[
    paradedb.term('description', 'shoes'),
    paradedb.term('rating', 5)
  ]
);
```

Additionally, multiple predicates should be combined into a single `paradedb.boolean` instead of using Postgres `AND`, `OR`, or `NOT`. This is a temporary limitation we expect
to remove in future releases.

### Regular Vacuums

Over time, a table's [visibility map](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-vm.html) can become outdated. This can negatively impact aggregate performance by increasing the time it takes to perform visibility checks over individual rows.

Running `VACUUM` over the table updates its visibility map. This can be automated by configuring [autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html).

```sql
VACUUM mock_items;
```

### Parallel Scan Workers

If the table is large enough, ParadeDB can invoke a parallel index-only scan for queries that return only a `COUNT(*)`.

```sql
-- This will invoke a parallel scan if mock_items becomes very large
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes';

-- This will not invoke a parallel scan
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) FROM mock_items
WHERE description @@@ 'shoes'
GROUP BY rating LIMIT 5;
```

If a parallel scan was invoked, a `Parallel Index Only Scan` will appear in the query's `EXPLAIN` output. Tuning Postgres' [parallel worker settings](/documentation/configuration/parallel)
can further accelerate parallel scans.

### Text Fast Fields

A known limitation of our underlying search library, Tantivy, is that text fast fields are slower to return than non-text fast fields.
Future releases will improve the speeds of text fast fields. In the meantime, we recommend using a non-text field for aggregates whenever possible. For instance,
passing a numeric instead of a text field into `COUNT`.
