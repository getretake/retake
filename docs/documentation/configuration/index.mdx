title: Index Build
---

### Indexing Memory

The default Postgres `maintenance_work_mem` value of `64MB` is quite conservative and can significantly slow down index builds. For large indexes,
we strongly recommend increasing `maintenance_work_mem`.

```bash postgresql.conf
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
```

<Note>
  `maintenance_work_mem` should not exceed the server's available memory.
</Note>

In addition to improving build times, `maintenance_work_mem` also affects the number of [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment) created in the index.
This is because, while ParadeDB tries to maintain as many segments as CPUs, a segment that cannot fit into memory will be split into a new segment.
As a result, an insufficient `maintenance_work_mem` can lead to significantly more segments than available CPUs, which degrades search performance.
To check if the chosen `maintenance_work_mem` value is high enough, you can [compare](/documentation/indexing/inspect_index#index-segments) the index's segment count
with the server's CPU count.

Generally speaking, `maintenance_work_mem` is the only setting that must be tuned to optimize index build times.
The rest have sensible defaults.

### Indexing Progress

ParadeDB can write indexing progress to the Postgres logs, which helps monitor the progress of a long-running `CREATE INDEX` statement.

First, Postgres logs must be enabled in `postgresql.conf` and Postgres must be restarted afterward.

```ini postgresql.conf
logging_collector = on
```

Next, set `paradedb.log_create_index_progress` to `true`. This creates Postgres `LOG:` entries every `100,000` rows with information on the indexing rate (in rows per second).

```sql
SET paradedb.log_create_index_progress = true;
```

The logs will appear in the directory specified in `log_directory`.

```sql
SHOW log_directory;
```

### Indexing Memory per Thread

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_memory_budget` defaults to `maintenance_work_mem` divided by total [parallelism](#indexing-threads). It sets the amount of memory to dedicate per indexing thread before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

The value is measured in megabytes. A value of `1024` is the same as `1GB`. In terms of raw indexing performance, larger is generally better.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_memory_budget = 1024;
```

### Indexing Threads

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_parallelism` sets the number of threads used during `CREATE INDEX`. The default is `0`, which
automatically detects the "available parallelism" of the host computer.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_parallelism = 8;
```
