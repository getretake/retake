## Index Settings

These settings can be set in `postgresql.conf` and affect system resources used during `CREATE INDEX`
and normal `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY` statements.

### Indexing Threads

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_parallelism` sets the number of threads used during `CREATE INDEX`. The default is `8`. A value of zero will
automatically detect "available parallelism" of the host computer.

For best performance it is recommended to use one less than the total number of host computer cores.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_parallelism = 8;
```

### Indexing Memory

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.create_index_memory_budget` sets the amount of memory to dedicate **per indexing thread** before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

If unset, Postgres' `maintenance_work_mem` value is used, but is first divided by the total parallelism (`paradedb.create_index_parallelism`).

In terms of raw indexing performance, larger is generally better.

The value is measured in megabytes. A value of `1024` is the same as `1GB`.

```sql
SET paradedb.create_index_memory_budget = 1024;
```

### Indexing Progress

When set to `true`, `paradedb.log_create_index_progress` creates Postgres `LOG:` entries every `100,000` rows with information on the indexing rate (in rows per second).
Defaults to `false`.

This can be useful to monitor the progress of a long-running `CREATE INDEX` statement. This setting can be changed by any user.

```sql
SET paradedb.log_create_index_progress = true;
```

### Statement Parallelism

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_parallelism` controls the number of indexing threads used during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY` statements. The default is `8`. A value of
zero will automatically detect "available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `1` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows at once, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_parallelism = 1;
```

### Statement Memory Budget

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_memory_budget` sets the amount of memory to dedicate **per indexing thread** before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

Like [indexing memory](#indexing-memory), it defaults to `maintenance_work_mem` divided by the total parallelism, and is measured in megabytes.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

Generally speaking, for statement level indexing, the parallelism value dictates the number of new index
[segments](#segment-settings) that will be created, so there's a trade-off between finishing the `INSERT/UPDATE` statement quickly and the
longer-term search overhead of having many additional index segments until `VACUUM` runs.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_memory_budget = 15;
```

## Segment Settings

A segment is an individual unit of an index. Each BM25 index is comprised of multiple segments. Every atomic insert or update creates a new segment.

### Target Segment Count

Having too many segments can negatively impact search performance. During a `VACUUM`, smaller segments can be merged into larger segments.

`target_segment_count` controls the number of segments that should exist and defaults to the number of available CPUs
on the host machine. This allows multiple threads to read from segments in parallel during a search.

<Note>
  While ParadeDB attempts to create `target_segment_count` segments, the actual
  number of segments may not always equal `target_segment_count`. For instance,
  it could exceed this number of `VACUUM` is not run, or fall below this number
  if the table contains a small number of rows.
</Note>

```sql
ALTER INDEX search_idx SET (target_segment_count = 8);
```

### Merge on Insert

`merge_on_insert` indicates if ParadeDB should look for merge opportunities during `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`
operations in addition to `VACUUM`s. The default is `true`. Setting this to `false` can improve `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY`
throughput at the expense of creating more segments that will later be merged by `VACUUM`.

```sql
ALTER INDEX search_idx SET (merge_on_insert = true);
```
