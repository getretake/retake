title: Throughput
---

Several settings can be used to tune the throughput of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements to the BM25 index.

## Merge on Insert

The BM25 index is made up of a number of individual [segments](/documentation/concepts/index#segment). Every atomic `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY`
creates a new segment.

Because having significantly more segments than available CPU cores negatively impacts search performance, ParadeDB tries
to merge smaller indexes into larger ones during an `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY`. This behavior can be disabled by explicitly setting `merge_on_insert` to `false`.
Doing so can increase `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` throughput at the expense of creating many more segments and slowing down subsequent search queries.

This option can be specified at index creation time or changed afterward:

```sql
-- At index creation
CREATE INDEX search_idx ON mock_items
USING bm25 (id, description)
WITH (key_field='id', merge_on_insert = false);

-- Changed afterward
ALTER INDEX search_idx SET (merge_on_insert = false);
```

If `merge_on_insert` is disabled, we recommend carefully configuring autovacuum to ensure that the index is merged at regular intervals.

## Statement Parallelism

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_parallelism` controls the number of indexing threads used during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY`. The default is `8`. A value of
zero will automatically detect "available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `1` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows at once, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_parallelism = 1;
```

## Statement Memory Budget

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_memory_budget` sets the amount of memory to dedicate **per indexing thread** before the index segment needs to be
written to disk.

Like [indexing memory](#indexing-memory), it defaults to `maintenance_work_mem` divided by the total parallelism, and is measured in megabytes.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` is ideal. If
your update patterns typically update many thousands of rows, a larger value might be preferred for greater indexing
concurrency.

Generally speaking, for statement level indexing, the parallelism value dictates the number of new index
[segments](#segment-settings) that will be created, so there's a trade-off between finishing the `INSERT/UPDATE` statement quickly and the
longer-term search overhead of having many additional index segments until `VACUUM` runs.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_memory_budget = 15;
```
