title: Throughput
---

Several settings can be used to tune the throughput of `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements to the BM25 index.

## Statement Memory

Like [indexing memory](/documentation/configuration/index#indexing-memory), the amount of memory available to `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`COPY` statements and number of segments
created is affected by `maintenance_work_mem`.

```bash postgresql.conf
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB
```

Generally speaking, this is the only setting that must be tuned for optimizing these statements.

## Statement Parallelism

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_parallelism` controls the number of indexing threads used during `INSERT/UPDATE/COPY`. The default is `0`, which automatically detects the
"available parallelism" of the host computer.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `1` can prevent unnecessary threads from being spun up. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_parallelism = 1;
```

## Statement Memory Budget

<Note>This setting requires superuser privileges.</Note>

`paradedb.statement_memory_budget`, like [indexing memory](/documentation/configuration/index#indexing-memory) defaults to `maintenance_work_mem` divided by the total parallelism. It sets the amount of memory to dedicate per indexing thread before the index segment needs to be
written to disk. The setting is measured in megabytes.

If your typical update patterns are single-row atomic `INSERT`s or `UPDATE`s, then a value of `15MB` can prevent unnecessary memory from being allocated. For bulk inserts
and updates, a larger value is better.

```sql
SET paradedb.statement_memory_budget = 15;
```
