To give database administrators fine-grained control over resource consumption, the BM25 index only uses as much memory and CPUs as allowed by the index's settings. Several of these settings
are set to match Postgres' `postgresql.conf` settings, which are quite conservative by default. Adjusting these settings allows ParadeDB to take advantage of the server's hardware and is
strongly recommended.

## Types of Settings

The BM25 index settings fall into one of two categories: Postgres settings and ParadeDB-specific settings.

### Postgres Setting

A Postgres setting can be found in the `postgresql.conf` file. These settings can be changed in two ways:

1. By editing the `postgresql.conf` file and restarting the server. This makes the setting permanent for all sessions.
2. By running `SET`. This temporarily changes the setting for the current session. Not all `postgresql.conf` settings can be changed with `SET` â€” some must be set in the file itself.

When changing `postgresql.conf` settings, it's important to remember that other Postgres processes also rely on these settings. For example, adjusting the
`shared_buffers` value to increase the buffer cache size applies to all tables and indexes.

### ParadeDB Setting

A ParadeDB setting begins with `paradedb.` and applies only to the current session. For instance:

```sql
SET paradedb.log_create_index_progress = true;
```
