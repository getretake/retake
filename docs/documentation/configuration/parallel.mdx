title: Parallel Scans
---

The BM25 index supports parallel scans. You can check if the Postgres query planner chose a parallel scan by running `EXPLAIN` on a query.
There are a few Postgres settings that can tune the performance of parallel scans.

## Max Worker Processes

`max_worker_processes` is a global limit for the number of available background workers across all connections. The default is `8`.
This setting must be changed inside `postgresql.conf`, and Postgres needs to be restarted afterward.

```init postgresql.conf
max_worker_processes = 16;
```

## Max Parallel Workers per Gather

`max_parallel_workers_per_gather` is a limit for the number of parallel workers that a single parallel query can use. The default is `2`.

```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 16;
```
