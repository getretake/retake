title: Parallel Scans
---

The BM25 index supports parallel scans. You can check if the Postgres query planner chose a parallel scan by running `EXPLAIN` on a query.
The following Postgres settings must be configured to increase the number of parallel workers.

## Max Parallel Workers

`max_parallel_workers` and `max_worker_processes` control how many workers are available to parallel scans.
`max_worker_processes` is a global limit for the number of available workers across all connections, and
`max_parallel_workers` specifies how many of those workers can be used for parallel scans.

These settings must be changed inside `postgresql.conf`, and Postgres needs to be restarted afterward.

```init postgresql.conf
max_worker_processes = 16;
max_parallel_workers = 16;
```

## Max Parallel Workers per Gather

`max_parallel_workers_per_gather` is a limit for the number of parallel workers that a single parallel query can use. The default is `2`.
This setting can be set in `postgresql.conf` to apply to all connections, or within a connection to apply to a single
session.

```sql
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 16;
```
