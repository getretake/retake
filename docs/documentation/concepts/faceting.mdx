The terms "aggregations" and "faceting" are often used interchangeably. In ParadeDB, faceting refers to enriching full
text search results with metrics or statistics. Facets can answer questions like

- What is the total number of products whose name matches the query `running shoes`?
- For each rating from 1 to 5, how many products were in each category that match the query `running shoes`?
