title: Quick Start
description: Add neural search to your Python app in under five minutes
---

<Note>
  This guide will show you how to run Retake in a development environment. For
  assistance in deploying to production, please [contact our
  team](http://calendly.com/philippemnoel).
</Note>

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Please ensure that you have [enabled logical
  replication](/setup) in your Postgres database.
</Info>

In this tutorial, we will implement neural search over Postgres using the `retakesearch` Python library.
This tutorial will only cover Retake-specific code and assumes that you already have a Python environment
where you would like to integrate Retake.

Please refer to the
[example Python Flask app](https://github.com/getretake/search/tree/dev/examples/flask) or
[example Nextjs app](https://github.com/getretake/search/tree/dev/examples/nextjs)
for complete examples of implementing search with Retake.

## Installation

<Info>**Prerequisite** Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.</Info>

Download the [docker compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getretake/retake/main/docker-compose.yml) and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This spins up the Retake engine, which is responsible for executing search queries and storing search data.
Next, `cd` into your Python project and install the Retake SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install retakesearch
```

```bash Typescript
npm install retake-search
```

</CodeGroup>

## Upload Data

Next, we use the Retake Python SDK to tell the Retake engine what data we wish to search over. Retake enables
developers to either upload their own data or integrate directly with Postgres.

### From Postgres

The `Index.add_source` function integrates Retake directly with Postgres. As long as the Retake engine is running, this
function only needs to be run once.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Client, Index, Database, Table

# When the Retake engine is run locally,
# this is the default API key/URL
client = Client(
  api_key="retake-test-key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Provide your Postgres database credentials here
database = Database(
    host="***",
    user="***",
    password="***",
    port=5432,
)

# Provide the table name, primary key, and columns you
# wish to search over here
table = Table(
    name="faqs"
    primary_key="id",
    columns=["questions", "answers"]
)

# Create an index
index = client.create_index("my_index")

# Populate the index with data from your table
index.add_source(database, table)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Client, Database, Table, Search } from "retake-search";

// When the Retake engine is run locally,
// this is the default API key/URL
const client = new Client("retake-test-key", "http://localhost:8000");

// Provide your Postgres database credentials here
const database = new Database("host", "user", "password", "port", "dbname");

// Provide the table name, primary key, and columns you
// wish to search over here
const columns = ["column_to_search"];
const table = new Table("table_name", "primary_key", columns);

// Create an index
const index = client.create_index("table_name");

// Populate the index with data from your table
index.addSource(database, table);
```

</CodeGroup>

### From Memory

Data stored outside of Postgres can also be added to an index.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
documents = [{"key": "value"}]
ids = ["id1"]

index.upsert(
  documents=documents,
  ids=ids
)
```

```typescript Typescript
const documents = [{ key: "value" }];
const ids = ["id1"];

index.upsert(documents, ids);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Execute a Search

Inside our Python application, we are ready to write and execute our first search query.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Search

# This executes a full-text (BM25) search
bm25_search_query = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")
response = index.search(bm25_search_query)

print(response)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Search } from "retake-search";
import { matchQuery } from "retake-search/helpers";

// This executes a full-text (BM25) search
const bm25Query = Search().query(matchQuery("column_to_search", "my query"));
const response = index.search(bm25Query);

print(response);
```

</CodeGroup>

Note that Retake's `Search` query builder is a forked version of the
[high-level OpenSearch Python DSL client](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/python-high-level).
Please refer to the [search guide]() for the essentials of writing search queries.

That's it! You've successfully executed a neural search query over your Postgres database.
