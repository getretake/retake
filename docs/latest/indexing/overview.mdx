## What is an Index?

In Postgres, indexes are database objects that provide a fast way to look up rows in a table. If you
imagine a Postgres table as a book, then an index is like the table of contents. Instead of flipping
through every page to find a chapter, the table of contents stores additional information that enables
readers to locate a chapter much faster.

By default, Postgres comes with several index types that are used to index different types of
data. For instance, numeric data types might be indexed using a B-tree (Balanced Tree) index, whereas
arrays might be indexed using a GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) index.

## ParadeDB Indexes

ParadeDB relies on three new index types to power its search capabilities: the BM25 index for full text search,
the HNSW index for dense vector search, and the sparse HNSW index for sparse vector search.

Once an index is created, it will automatically stay in sync with the underlying table data, and
does not need to be re-created unless the table schema changes (for instance, if a column is renamed or deleted).
To not slow down transactions while indexing, indexes follow _weak consistency_, meaning that they are updated
automatically in the background after a transaction commits, and become consistent soon after (although your
mileage may vary depending on the size of your transaction(s)).
