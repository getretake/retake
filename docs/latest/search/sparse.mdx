title: Sparse Vector Search
---

<Note>
  Creating a [sparse HNSW index](/latest/indexing/sparse) over a table can
  significantly improve query times.

## Overview

Sparse vectors, generated by recent models like SPLADE, are characterized by the fact that most of their
entries are zero.

## Basic Usage

The following example returns rows sorted by L2 distance with respect to the query vector. Note that
the syntax is identical to dense vector search.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <-> '[0,1,0,2]';
```

Cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <=> '[0,1,0,2]';
```

Inner product:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <#> '[0,1,0,2]';
```

Under the hood, ParadeDB uses `pg_sparse` for sparse vector search, which is ParadeDB's fork of `pgvector`.
Please refer to the [`pg_sparse` documentation](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_sparse) for more details.

## Casting

In cases where Postgres is unable to infer whether a vector is sparse or dense, you can explicitly cast sparse vectors
to the `svector` data type.

```sql
SELECT '[0,1,0,2]'::svector <-> '[1,2,0,3]'::svector;
```
