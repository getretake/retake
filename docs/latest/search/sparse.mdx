title: Sparse Vector Search
---

<Note>
  Creating a [sparse HNSW index](/latest/indexing/sparse) over a table can
  significantly improve query times.
</Note>

## Overview

Similarity search uses the HNSW algorithm to find rows in a table that match a given vector.
This type of search is especially useful for semantic search.

## Basic Usage

The following example returns rows sorted by L2 distance with respect to the query vector.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1,2,3]';
```

Cosine distance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY embedding <=> '[1,2,3]';
```

Inner product:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY embedding <#> '[1,2,3]';
```

Under the hood, ParadeDB uses `pg_sparse` for sparse vector search, which is ParadeDB's fork of `pgveector`.
Please refer to the [`pg_sparse` documentation](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_sparse) for more details.
