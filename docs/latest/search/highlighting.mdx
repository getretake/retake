title: Highlighting

## Overview

Highlighting refers to the practice of visually emphasizing the portions of a document that match a user's
search query, which aids users in quickly identifying the relevance of the search results to
their inquiry. In ParadeDB, highlighted snippets of text are wrapped in `<b></b>` tags.

## Basic Usage

After calling `create_bm25` to create a BM25 index and associated schema, you can use the new schema's `highlight` function
to return a table of highlighted fragments of text that match your query. This function only works over text fields.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.highlight('<query>', highlight_field => '<field_name>');
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
SELECT s.*, r.highlight_bm25
FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard OR category:electronics') as s
LEFT JOIN search_idx.highlight('description:keyboard OR category:electronics', highlight_field => 'description') as r ON s.id = r.id;
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="field_name" required>
  The name of the indexed field to be highlighted in the returned fragment.
</ParamField>

All parameters to the `search` function are applicable here. The `highlight` function should receive identical
arguments to the `search` function, along with an additional required `highlight_field` parameter.
