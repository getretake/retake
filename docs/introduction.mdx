Retake is open-source infrastructure for vector data streams, purpose-built for low-latency applications. It ensures that
your inputs/sources of truth and vectors are always in sync without the time, complexity, and cost of maintaining your own pipelines.

## Why Retake

With the growing popularity of vector databases, thereâ€™s ongoing debate around using dedicated vector stores or keeping vectors in the main database using extensions
like `pgvector`. While each approach has its merits, we've seen many larger-scale companies opt for separate vector stores to isolate the resources used by vector
operations from the rest of their database operations. In situations like this, it's important to have resilient and
horizontally scalable infrastructure in place for handling vector data streams and keeping vectors in sync with their sources of truth.

Retake is a good fit for you if you:

- Store inputs and vectors separately
- Want a standalone process that updates vectors in response to input changes in
  your source database.

For instance, if your inputs are documents stored in a SQL table and your vectors are
stored in a search engine or a vector database.

## Key Features

### Real-Time or Batch Updates

Retake enables you to sync vectors in scheduled batches or in real-time. Built on top of Kafka, Retake's
Change Data Capture (CDC) engine achieves sub-10ms end-to-end data latency for real-time updates,
excluding variable model inference time.

### Extensible Python SDK

You can configure any source, sink, transformation, and embedding model as code. Joining and filtering tables
or adding metadata is easily done from Python functions.

### Deploy Anywhere

You can run Retake anywhere, from your laptop to a distributed cloud system.
