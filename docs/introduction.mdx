Retake is open-source infrastructure for vector data streams, purpose-built for synchronizing high volumes of embeddings at low latency.
It ensures consistency between your inputs/sources of truth and vectors without the time, complexity, and cost of maintaining your own pipelines.

## Why Retake

With the growing popularity of vector databases, many sophisticated teams opt to store vectors in separate databases to
isolate the resources used by vector operations from the rest of their database operations. At scale,
it's important to have resilient and horizontally scalable infrastructure that efficiently updates vectors.

Retake is a good fit for you if you:

- Store inputs and vectors separately
- Want a standalone process that updates vectors in response to input changes in
  your source database

For instance, if your inputs are documents stored in a SQL table and your vectors are
stored in a search engine or a vector database.

## Key Features

### Out-of-the-Box Data Sync

Existing vector stores are siloes that require complex and sometimes brittle mechanisms for data synchronization.
Retake provides the missing connectors that allow seamless data synchronization without the need for extensive
configuration or third-party tools.

### True Real-Time Updates

Retake's connectors achieve sub-10ms end-to-end data latency, excluding variable model inference times.

### Extensible Python SDK

You can configure any source, sink, transformation, and embedding model as code. Joining and filtering tables
or adding metadata is easily done from Python functions.

### Scalable and Efficient

Built on top of Kafka, Retake is designed to handle large volumes of data and high-throughput workloads.

### Deployable Anywhere

You can run Retake anywhere, from your laptop to a distributed cloud system.
