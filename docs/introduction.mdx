Retake is real-time keyword (BM25) + semantic (kNN) search (i.e. neural search) infrastructure for developers,
built to stay in sync with fast-changing databases. Retake acts as a search layer around any Postgres database
and provides a straightforward SDK for developers to add neural search to any Python application.

## Why Retake

Retake is a good fit for developers that

1. Have investigated vector databases for semantic search, but also want the capabilities of traditional search
   (e.g. keyword and text search, aggregations, filtering, ranking, etc.).
2. Are looking for an opinionated neural search library that "just works" without the overhead of managing a vector store,
   search engine, embedding models, and data pipelines.

## Key Features

**Always in Sync**

Built with Kafka and OpenSearch, Retake connects to a Postgres database, indexes, and embeds specified documents.
As data changes or new data arrives in Postgres, Retake automatically stays in sync and re-generates embeddings.

**Low-Code SDK**

Retake provides intuitive search SDKs that drop into any Python application (other languages coming soon).
The core API is just two functions.

**Open/ElasticSearch DSL Compatible**

Retake's query interface is built on top of the the high-level OpenSearch Python client, enabling developers
to operate with the full expressiveness of the OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language).

**Deployable Anywhere**

Retake is deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a distributed cloud system.
