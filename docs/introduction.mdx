## What is ParadeDB?

ParadeDB is a Postgres-based ElasticSearch alternative, engineered for lightning-fast full text,
similarity, and hybrid search.

Today, developers implementing search face one of two options: adopt an external service like ElasticSearch,
which is powerful but painful to run, tune, and sync, or use Postgres' native search features, which are pleasant to
use but nowhere near as capable as a full search engine.

ParadeDB aims to be the best of both worlds, providing developers with the simplicity of one Postgres
database with the search capabilities of a world-class search engine.

## Why ParadeDB

ParadeDB provides the most comprehensive search features of any Postgres database. ParadeDB is a good fit for you if:

- You want a single, Postgres-based source of truth and hate duplicating data across multiple services.
- You want to perform full-text search over large volumes of documents stored in Postgres without compromising on performance or scalability.
- You want to combine ANN/similarity search with full text search for improved semantic matching.

ParadeDB is **not** a good fit if:

- You are looking for an observability solution that ingests and monitors logs.
  We are currently not building towards this use case of ElasticSearch.

## Current Status

ParadeDB is currently in private beta.

The focus of the core team is on developing the open-source version of ParadeDB. We're also building a
self-serve managed cloud version, which will launch in early 2024. We've started giving access to select
cohorts from our [waitlist](https://paradedb.typeform.com/to/jHkLmIzx?typeform-source=www.paradedb.com).

For users who have been selected for the private beta, we've put up documentation to help you get started.
We're actively fleshing out the documentation â€” if you have any questions in the meantime, please use the
Intercom widget in the bottom right corner of the screen for live chat support with a member of our team.
