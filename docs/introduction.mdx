Retake is the fastest way to unlock keyword + semantic search for enterprise databases.

By connecting directly to Postgres, Retake accelerates the development of AI applications that
require searching, matching, or analyzing database documents. Retake also provides simple search
SDKs that snap into any Python or Typescript application.

## Why Retake

Retake is a good fit for developers that

1. Have investigated vector databases for semantic search, but also want the capabilities of traditional search
   (e.g. keyword-based search, faceting, efficient filtering, etc.).
2. Are looking for an opinionated, capable search library that "just works" without the overhead of managing a vector store,
   search engine, embedding models, and data ingestion pipelines.
3. Have large volumes of documents stored in Postgres that are expensive and time-consuming to reindex or re-embed
   with batch jobs.

## Use Cases

**Text Reconciliation**

Retake can be embedded into backends that map incoming text to the most similar match in a database. For instance, an
HR software company may want to map receipts uploaded by employees to recent transactions.

**Personalized Recommendations**

Recommendation engines that previously relied on rule-based approaches can now harness deeper semantic insights,
increasing the precision and relevance of their suggestions.

**Universal Search**

Retake's low-code SDKs radically simplify the integration of universal search in an application.

## Key Features

**Always in Sync**

Retake leverages logical-replication-based Change-Data-Capture (CDC) to integrate directly with Postgres. As data changes or new data arrives,
Retake ensures that the indexed data is kept in sync.

**Intelligent Vector Cache**

Whenever data is changed in Postgres, Retake updates the embedding/vector representation of that data behind the scenes.
Vectors are automatically cached for lightning-fast query results with semantic understanding.

**Low-Code SDK**

Retake provides intuitive search SDKs that drop into any Python or Typescript application (other languages coming soon).
The core API is just a few functions.

**Open/ElasticSearch DSL Compatible**

Retake enables developers to query with the full expressiveness of the OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language).

**Deployable Anywhere**

Retake is deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a distributed cloud system.
