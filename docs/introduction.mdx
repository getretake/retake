Retake is real-time keyword (BM25) + semantic (kNN) search (i.e. neural search) infrastructure for developers,
built to stay in sync with fast-changing databases. Retake integrates directly with Postgres and extends
its capabilities by providing a low-code SDK that adds neural search to any Python application.

## Why Retake

Retake is a good fit for developers that

1. Have investigated vector databases for semantic search, but also want the capabilities of traditional search
   (e.g. keyword-based search, faceting, filtering, ranking, etc.).
2. Are looking for an opinionated neural search library that "just works" without the overhead of managing a vector store,
   search engine, embedding models, and data pipelines.

## Key Features

**Always in Sync**

Built with Kafka and OpenSearch, Retake connects to a Postgres database, indexes, and automatically creates embeddings
for tables and columns specified by the developer. As data changes or new data arrives in Postgres, Retake ensures that
the indexed data and its embeddings are kept in sync.

**Low-Code SDK**

Retake provides intuitive search SDKs that drop into any Python application (other languages coming soon).
The core API is just two functions.

**Open/ElasticSearch DSL Compatible**

Retake's query interface is built on top of the the high-level OpenSearch Python client, enabling developers
to query with the full expressiveness of the OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language).

**Deployable Anywhere**

Retake is deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a distributed cloud system.
