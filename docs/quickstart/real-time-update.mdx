title: "Send Real-Time Updates"

<Warning>
  Real-time update functionality is still under development. [Join the
  waitlist](https://retake.typeform.com/to/JTcYtLay) to be notified when it's
  production ready.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You must have a real-time server running as per these
  [instructions](/deployment/local).
</Info>

Real-time updates are useful when the number of embeddings is very large and batch updates are too expensive.
Retake provides a real-time server that listens for `Source` changes and incrementally updates the `Sink`.
Registering your source and sink with the real-time server is just two lines of code.

```bash main.py
from retake import RealTime

# Host is the address set in the docker-compose.yml file
realtime_server = RealTime(host="0.0.0.0")
pipeline.pipe_real_time(realtime_server)
```
