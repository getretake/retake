title: Phrase Search
---

<Note>
  To enable phrase search, a field must be indexed with
  [record](/api-reference/indexing/record) of `position`.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

Phrases with spaces must be wrapped inside double quotes. The following query finds all documents with the word `plastic` followed immediately by `keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:"plastic keyboard"');
```

## Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator allows for other words to come in between words in the query phrase. For instance, the following query finds documents containing
the word `ergonomic` followed by `keyboard`, allowing for a maximum of one word in between.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:"ergonomic keyboard"~1');
```

## Phrase Prefix

The `*` prefix operator allows for the last term in the phrase query to be the prefix of another word. For instance,
`"plastic keyb"*` matches `plastic keyboard`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:"plastic keyb"*');
```
