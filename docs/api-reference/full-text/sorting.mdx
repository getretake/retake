## Tiebreaking

By default, search results are ordered in descending order by their BM25 score. If multiple results have identical BM25 scores, the `key_field` is used as a tie-breaker.
This behavior can be controlled with the `stable_sort` parameter.

If `true`, equally-scored or ordered results will be sub-sorted by their `key_field`. As a
consequence of score evaluation and sorting, query times will be slower. This is useful for testing or anytime where
results need to be deterministic but the score itself is not necessary. See the `<index_name>.score_bm25()` function
for retrieving document scores.

If `false`, scores are not generated and instead results are returned in an un-deterministic index order. The benefit
of this is that the results are returned as quickly as possible. This is useful for queries that are known to return
many thousands or millions of rows.

`stable_sort` defaults to `true` and can be passed into `search`, `score_bm25`, and `snippet`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard', stable_sort => false);
```

## Custom Ordering

By default, the rows are ordered by their BM25 score but can be ordered by any [fast field](/api-reference/indexing/fast_fields) instead by specifying `order_by_field`.

The sort order can be changed by specifying `order_by_direction`. The default is `asc`. These arguments can be passed into
`search`, `score_bm25`, and `snippet`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  'description:keyboard',
  order_by_field => 'rating',
  order_by_direction => 'asc' | 'desc'
)
```
