## Limit

The `search`, `score_bm25`, and `snippet` functions accept a `limit_rows` option which pushes limits down to the search query. Using `limit_rows`
instead of the SQL `LIMIT` clause can significantly improve query performance.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes', limit_rows => 2);
```

## Offset

Similarly, `offset_rows` efficiently pushes down offsets to the search query and should be used instead of
the SQL `OFFSET` clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes', offset_rows => 2);
```
