title: JSON Search
---

## Basic Usage

Use `.` to search over text values nested inside JSON. For instance, the following query would search over a field with values like `{"metadata": {"color": "white"}}`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('metadata.color:white');
```

When dealing with JSON arrays, the array elements are “flattened” so that each element can be searched individually. This means that if a JSON array is encountered, each element in the array is treated as a separate value and indexed accordingly. For example, given the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "colors": ["red", "green", "blue"]
  }
}
```

The JSON array in the colors field is flattened to emit separate terms for each color. This allows for individual search queries like:

```sql
'metadata.colors:red'
'metadata.colors:green'
'metadata.colors:blue'
```

Each of these queries would correctly match the document containing the JSON array.

<Note>
  Searching for integers in a nested JSON structure is **not** supported. For example:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM <index_name>.search('metadata.attributes:4');
  ```
