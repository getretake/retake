<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](/api-reference/indexing/create_index).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

Every BM25 index comes with a `search` function, which returns rows of a table that match a search query. By default, rows are sorted by relevance.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('<query>');
```

## Query Language

The query string accepts a mini query language which can be used to construct expressive queries.

Each query must specify which field to search over. In the following example, we are querying for
`keyboard` against the `description` field.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard');
```
