<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](/api-reference/full-text/index).
</Note>

## Basic Usage

Every BM25 index comes with a `search` function, which returns rows of a table that match a search query. By default, rows are sorted by relevance.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.search('<query>');
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The [ParadeQL](#paradeql) query string. See the documentation below for how to
  construct this string.
</ParamField>

## ParadeQL

The query string accepts ParadeQL, a mini query language which can be used to construct more expressive queries.

In ParadeQL, each query must specify which field to search over. In the following example, we are querying for
`keyboard` against the `description` field.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard');
```
