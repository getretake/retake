Full text search is a technique that finds entries in a collection of text based on the presence of keywords, phrases, or partial words.

The algorithm used by ParadeDB's full text search is BM25, which stands for Best Matching 25.
It ranks documents by considering how often a term appears and how unique that term is across all
documents.
