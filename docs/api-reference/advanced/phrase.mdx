## Basic Usage

Searches for documents containing a [phrase](/api-reference/concepts/phrase), with `slop` allowing for some flexibility in term proximity.
The field must be indexed with a [record](/api-reference/indexing/record) of `position`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.phrase(
		field => 'description',
		phrases => ARRAY['robot', 'building', 'kit']
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases" required>
  An `ARRAY` of words that form the search phrase. These words must appear in
  the specified order within the document for a match to occur, although some
  flexibility is allowed based on the `slop` parameter.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="slop" default={0}>
  A slop of `0` requires the terms to appear exactly as they are in the phrase
  and adjacent to each other. Higher slop values allow for more distance and
  flexibility between the terms, accommodating variations in the phrase's
  structure within the document.
</ParamField>
