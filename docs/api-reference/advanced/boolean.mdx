## Basic Usage

Boolean queries filter documents based on the logical relationships defined by their subqueries, considering:

- Documents that satisfy all `must` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy none of the `must_not` conditions.
- Documents that satisfy at least one condition from either `must` or `should`.

Boolean queries are a powerful way to combine the results of several different queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.boolean(
	    should => ARRAY[
		    paradedb.parse('description:shoes'),
		    paradedb.phrase_prefix(field => 'description', phrases => ARRAY['book']),
		    paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'speaker'),
		    paradedb.fuzzy_term(field => 'description', value => 'wolo')
	    ]
    )
);
```

<ParamField body="must">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="must_not">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions which must not be
  matched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="should">
  A query object or an `ARRAY` of query objects as conditions of which at least
  one must be matched.
</ParamField>

In order for a boolean query to return a result, one of `must` or `should` must be provided.
`must_not` acts as a mask and does not produce a result set. For instance, in order to find
all rows from `mock_items` where `description` does not contain `shoes`, `paradedb.all()` should be used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  query => paradedb.boolean(
    should => paradedb.all(),
    must_not => paradedb.parse('description:shoes')
  )
);
```
