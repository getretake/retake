## Basic Usage

Matches all documents with a non-null value in the specified field. All matched documents get a BM25 score of `1.0`.

<Note>
  Will error if the field has not been indexed as a [fast
  field](/api-reference/indexing/fast_fields).
</Note>

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.exists(field => 'rating')
);
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>

This query is useful for filtering on `NULL` values inside a boolean query. For instance, the following code block
finds all rows with `description` matching `shoes` that have a non-null `rating`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  query => paradedb.boolean(
    must => ARRAY[
      paradedb.parse('description:shoes'),
      paradedb.exists('rating')
    ]
  )
);
```
