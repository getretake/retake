title: Term
---

## Basic Usage

Matches documents containing a specified term. It is matched directly against terms in the index.

<Note>
  A term is treated as a token and is not tokenized further. This means that a
  document will not match unless one of its tokens is an exact match for the
  term provided in `value`.
</Note>

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'shoes')
);

SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  query => paradedb.term(
    field => 'created_at',
    value => TIMESTAMP '2023-05-01 09:12:34'
  )
);
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term. If omitted,
  all indexed fields will be searched.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value" required>
  Value to search for in the document field.
</ParamField>
