## Basic Usage

Matches documents containing a specified term. The term value is treated as a token and is not tokenized further. It is
matched directly against terms in the index.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'shoes')
);

SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
  query => paradedb.term(
    field => 'created_at',
    value => TIMESTAMP '2023-05-01 09:12:34'
  )
);
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term. If omitted,
  all indexed fields will be searched.

<ParamField body="value" required>Value to search for in the document field.</ParamField>
