The query builder API exposes advanced query objects that are not available to the ParadeQL query syntax.
This API can be used for complex queries where the full text search API is not sufficient.

## Basic Usage

The `search` function thatâ€™s generated for your index can accept query objects instead of a query string. Nearly all the query types implemented in Tantivy, our underlying search engine, are exposed to Postgres.
A query string itself is parsed into a query object, and can be used anywhere in a query tree with `paradedb.parse`.

`paradedb.parse` is implicitly performed if a query string is passed directly to the search function. These two queries are identical:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes');
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(query => paradedb.parse('description:shoes'));
```

## Composable Query Objects

These query objects are composable, which allows for arbitrarily fine-grained queries. For instance, the following query looks
for documents containing either the term `running` or `shoes` and boosts the relevance of documents matching `shoes`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.boolean(
        should => ARRAY[
            paradedb.boost(query => paradedb.parse('description:shoes'), boost => 2.0),
            paradedb.term(field => 'description', value => 'running')
        ]
    )
);
```
