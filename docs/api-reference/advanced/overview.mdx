The advanced search API exposes advanced query objects that are not available to the ParadeQL query syntax.
These query objects are composable, which allows for arbitrarily fine-grained queries.

## Basic Usage

The `search` function thatâ€™s generated for your index can accept query objects instead of a query string. Nearly all the query types implemented in Tantivy, our underlying search engine, are exposed to Postgres.
A query string itself is parsed into a query object, and can be used anywhere in a query tree with `paradedb.parse`.

`paradedb.parse` is implicitly performed if a query string is passed directly to the search function. These two queries are identical:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes');
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(query => paradedb.parse('description:shoes'));
```
