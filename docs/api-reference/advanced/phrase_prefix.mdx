title: Phrase Prefix
---

## Basic Usage

Identifies documents containing a [phrase](/api-reference/concepts/phrase) followed by a term prefix. The field must be indexed with a
[record](/api-reference/indexing/record) of `position`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
	query => paradedb.phrase_prefix(
		field => 'description',
		phrases => ARRAY['har']
	)
);
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="phrases" required>
  An `ARRAY` of words that the search is looking to match, followed by a term
  prefix rather than a complete term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="max_expansion">
  Limits the number of term variations that the prefix can expand to during the
  search. This helps in controlling the breadth of the search by setting a cap
  on how many different terms the prefix can match.
</ParamField>
