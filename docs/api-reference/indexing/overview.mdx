## BM25 Index

The BM25 index enables ParadeDB to perform full text search over a Postgres table. When ParadeDB indexes data, it breaks down text into smaller chunks called tokens, which are then stored in the
BM25 index.

This index is strongly consistent, which means that new data is immediately searchable across all connections. Once an index is created, it automatically stays in sync with the underlying table as the data changes.

## What is BM25?

Full text search is a technique that finds all relevant entries in a collection of documents based on the presence of keywords and phrases. The algorithm used by ParadeDBâ€™s full text search, BM25, is widely used by modern search engines.
