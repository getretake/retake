## Limit

The `LIMIT` clause should be used with the `@@@` operator to limit the size of the result set.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes'
LIMIT 1;
```

## Offset

The `OFFSET` clause should be used with the `@@@` operator to offset the result set.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes'
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```
