## The `@@@` Operator

While the [`search` function](/api-reference/full-text/overview) is useful for simple full text search queries, it is **not optimized** for

- Returning hundreds of thousands or millions of documents as quickly as possible
- Usage in complex SQL queries with other "plain SQL" `WHERE` or `JOIN` clauses

For more complex queries, we recommend using the `@@@` operator. The `@@@` operator means "find **all rows** matching a full text query." It's designed to return large numbers of rows as quickly as possible and interacts well with `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`/`LIMIT`, and `GROUP BY` clauses as well as standard query operators such
as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

`@@@` itself **does not** perform any ordering, offsets or limits. These are now operations that need to be added to the overall query with `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`, and `LIMIT`.
`@@@` also does not return scores. If scores are required, `score_bm25` should be used.

<Note>
We are undergoing an internal refactor to move more of the API away from the `<index_name>.search` syntax and towards the `@@@` operator, which delivers a number of performance and
syntax improvements. Over time, we expect to more heavily recommend the `@@@` operator.

## Basic Usage

The left-hand side of `@@@` must be the key field. The right-hand side accepts either a [full text query string](api-reference/full-text/overview) or a [query builder function](/api-reference/advanced/overview).

For instance, the following full text queries will return the same rows, but not necessarily in the same order.

```sql
-- search() syntax
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes');

-- @@@ operator syntax
SELECT * FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoes';
```

Similarly, the following query builder functions will return the same rows.

```sql
-- search() syntax
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.term('description', 'shoes')
);

-- @@@ operator syntax
SELECT * FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.term('description', 'shoes');
```
