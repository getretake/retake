title: Autocomplete
---

In user-facing search, autocomplete refers to the process of suggesting relevant results as the user is typing.
Several of ParadeDB's search APIs can be mixed and matched to build a full-fledged autocomplete experience.

<Note>
This guide uses the [`mock_items` table](/api-reference/introduction#get-started).

## Fuzzy Term

Suppose we want to find all documents containing `shoes`, but the user typed in `shoez`. The `fuzzy_term` query can find search results that approximately match the query term while allowing for minor typos in the input.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.fuzzy_term(
        field => 'description',
        value => 'shoez'
    )
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Fuzzy Phrase

Suppose the user provides a misspelled phrase like `ruining shoez` when searching for `running shoes`. Because `fuzzy_term` treats `value` as a single token,
passing the entire phrase to `fuzzy_term` will not yield any matches. Instead, `fuzzy_phrase` should be used. `fuzzy_phrase` finds documents where
**any** of the query's tokens are a `fuzzy_term` match.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.fuzzy_phrase(
        field => 'description',
        value => 'ruining shoez'
    )
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

For a stricter result set, `fuzzy_phrase` can be configured to match documents if **all** query tokens match.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.fuzzy_phrase(
        field => 'description',
        value => 'ruining shoez',
        match_all_terms => true
    )
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
(1 row)
```
</Accordion>

## Multiple Fuzzy Fields

Suppose we want to compare a query against both `description` and `category`. The `boolean` query can be used to query across multiple fields.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.boolean(
        should => ARRAY[
            paradedb.fuzzy_phrase(field => 'description', value => 'ruining shoez'),
            paradedb.fuzzy_phrase(field => 'category', value => 'ruining shoez')
        ]
    )
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Ngram Term

Suppose we want to suggest results when the user has only typed part of a word, like `sho`. In this scenario,
the [ngrams tokenizer](/api-reference/indexing/create_index#ngrams) can be used to convert documents into ngram tokens.

For the purpose of this example, let's assume that we have an index called `ngrams_idx`:

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
    index_name => 'ngrams_idx',
    schema_name => 'public',
    table_name => 'mock_items',
    key_field => 'id',
    text_fields => paradedb.field(
        'description',
        tokenizer => paradedb.tokenizer('ngram', min_gram => 3, max_gram => 3, prefix_only => false)
    )
);
```

With `description` tokenized into n-grams, we can search for partial words.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM ngrams_idx.search('description:sho');
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Ngram Term Set

When querying against an ngrams field, all ngrams of the query must match in order for the document to be considered a match.
This means that a query like `hsoes` does not match `shoes`, because the `hso` token does not match any of the tokens of `shoes`.

To match documents where **any** ngram token of the query matches, the `fuzzy_phrase` query can again be used. Since we are looking for
exact ngram matches, the `distance` parameter can be lowered to `0`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM ngrams_idx.search(
    query => paradedb.fuzzy_phrase(
        field => 'description',
        value => 'hsoes',
        distance => 0
    )
);
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
```csv
     description     | rating | category
---------------------+--------+----------
 Sleek running shoes |      5 | Footwear
 White jogging shoes |      3 | Footwear
 Generic shoes       |      4 | Footwear
(3 rows)
```
</Accordion>

## Further Customization

This guide has demonstrated how the query builder functions like `paradedb.boolean` can be used to compose new, powerful queries.
We encourage you to use these functions to experiment with queries that satisfy your use case.
