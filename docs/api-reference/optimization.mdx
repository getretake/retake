title: Query Optimization

## The `@@@` Operator

Passing a [limit](/api-reference/full-text/pagination#limit) into the [`search` function](/api-reference/full-text/overview) is the fastest way to return the top `N` documents from the index. 
However, this function is not optimized for returning large values of `N`.

The `@@@` operator means "find **all rows** matching a full text query." It's designed to return large numbers of rows as quickly as possible and interacts well with `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`/`LIMIT`, and `GROUP BY` clauses as well as standard query operators such
as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

`@@@` **does not** perform any ordering, offsets or limits. These are now operations that need to be added to the overall query with `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`, and `LIMIT`. 
`@@@` also does not return scores. If scores are required, `score_bm25` should be used.

## Basic Usage

The left-hand side of `@@@` must be the key field. The right-hand side accepts either a [full text query string](api-reference/full-text/overview) or a [query builder function](/api-reference/advanced/overview).

```sql
-- Query string
SELECT * FROM mock_items 
WHERE id @@@ 'description:shoe';

-- Query builder function
SELECT * FROM mock_items 
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.term('description', 'shoe');
```
