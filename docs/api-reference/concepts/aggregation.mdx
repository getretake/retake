title: Aggregations
---

An aggregation summarizes data as metrics or statistics. They can answer questions like

- What is the total number of products in my catalog?
- What is the average rating of each product per customer segment?

ParadeDB supports two types of aggregations: bucket and metric aggregations. Bucket aggregations group the data into
buckets based on certain fields. For instance, a histogram is a type of bucket aggregation. Metric aggregations compute
statistics over a field. For instance, an average is a type of metric aggregation.
