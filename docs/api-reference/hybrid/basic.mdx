title: Basic Hybrid Search
---

<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, please
  ensure that you have created both BM25 and HNSW indexes.
</Note>

## Overview

Hybrid search, which combines BM25-based full text scores with vector-based
similarity scores, is especially useful in scenarios where you want to match by both
exact keywords and semantic meaning.

## Basic Usage

To calculate a row's hybrid score, ParadeDB introduces a `score_hybrid` function. Under the hood,
this function does the following:

1. Calculates the BM25 and similarity scores for the respective queries
2. Applies minmax normalization to both scores, which sets the lowest score to `0` and the highest score to `1`
3. Calculates the weighted mean of the normalized scores

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.score_hybrid(
  bm25_query => '<bm25_query>',
  similarity_query => '<similarity_query>',
  bm25_weight => <bm25_weight>,
  similarity_weight => <similarity_weight>,
  bm25_limit_n => <bm25_limit_n>,
  similarity_limit_n => <similarity_limit_n>
);
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_hybrid(
    bm25_query => 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics',
    similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
    bm25_weight => 0.9,
    similarity_weight => 0.1
);
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the BM25 index associated with this table. For instance, if you
  ran `CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table USING bm25 ((my_table.*))`, the index
  name would be `'my_index'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="bm25_query" required>
  The full text search query string. For instance, `'description:keyboard'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity_query" required>
  The similarity query string. For instance, `'''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding'`.
  Note that double single quotes are used to escape the single quote inside the string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="bm25_weight" default={0.5}>
  The weight applied to the BM25 score. It is recommended that this weight and the similarity weight
  add up to `1`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity_weight" default={0.5}>
  The weight applied to the similarity score. It is recommended that this weight and the BM25 weight
  add up to `1`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="bm25_limit_n" default={100}>
  The maximum number of rows that are considered for ranking using BM25.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity_limit_n" default={100}>
  The maximum number of rows that are considered for ranking using similarity search.
</ParamField>

## With Advanced Search

[Advanced search functions](/api-reference/full-text/complex) can be passed directly into `bm25_query`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.score_hybrid(
    bm25_query => paradedb.disjunction_max(disjuncts => ARRAY[paradedb.parse('description:shoes')]),
    similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
    bm25_weight => 0.9,
    similarity_weight => 0.1
);
```
