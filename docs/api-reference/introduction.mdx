The ParadeDB API makes use of PostgreSQL operators and functions to enable full text, similarity, and hybrid search over Postgres tables. 

All code blocks in this section use a table called `mock_items`. We recommend creating this table in your database to follow along.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);
```
