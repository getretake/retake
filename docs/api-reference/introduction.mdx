## Overview

ParadeDB uses PostgreSQL operators and functions to enable full text and similarity search over Postgres tables.

## Full Text vs. Similarity Search

Full text search is a technique that finds entries in a collection of text based on the presence of specific keywords and phrases.
Similarity search, on the other hand, matches documents based on semantic meaning.

For instance, consider a movie review site that lets users search for movies. Movie titles would benefit from full text search, since users are
likely looking for exact keywords like `Harry` and `Potter`. On the other hand, movie descriptions may benefit from similarity search.
Users that query for `the boy who lived` may be looking for `Harry Potter` even though these phrases share no common keywords.

Many modern applications use a combination of full text and similarity search. This process is called [hybrid search](/api-reference/similarity/hybrid).

## Get Started

All code blocks in this section reference a table called `mock_items` and a BM25 index called `search_idx`.
We recommend creating these relations in your database to follow along.

To create `mock_items`, simply run the `paradedb.create_bm25_test_table` procedure.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);
```

To create `search_idx`, run the following procedure. The [indexing](/api-reference/indexing) section provides details on how this
statement works.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  text_fields => paradedb.field('description') || paradedb.field('category'),
  numeric_fields => paradedb.field('rating'),
  boolean_fields => paradedb.field('in_stock'),
  datetime_fields => paradedb.field('created_at'),
  json_fields => paradedb.field('metadata')
);
```
