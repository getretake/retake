<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS, Azure, or GCP account, is now available. Please [contact
  sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Note>

Deploying ParadeDB into production consists of two steps:

1. Configure [logical replication](#logical-replication) between your primary Postgres and ParadeDB. This requires a [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) license.
2. Configure [high availability](#high-availability) for ParadeDB.

### Logical Replication

If your primary Postgres is a managed service like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, or Azure Postgres, follow [these instructions](/deploy/logical-replication).
If your primary Postgres is self-hosted, follow [these instructions](/deploy/logical-replication#self-hosted). If you do not use Postgres as your primary,
you may skip this step.

### High Availability

ParadeDB uses a Kubernetes operator called CloudNativePG to implement high availability. Follow [these instructions](/deploy/high-availability) to set up
CloudNativePG.

### That's It!

You've successfully deployed a production-ready, highly available ParadeDB cluster with the following architecture:
