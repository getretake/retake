<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS, Azure, or GCP account, is now available. Please [contact
  sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Note>

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres, connected via logical replication. This
allows ParadeDB to integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, and Azure Postgres. It also isolates search
and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

## Logical Replication

Logical replication is a tool, native to Postgres, which enables keeping two or more Postgres databases synchronized in near real-time
in a fully transaction-safe way, without needing an ETL or CDC pipeline (e.g. Debezium). It is possible to ingest a subset of tables or rows/columns
via logical replication, and it is possible to ingest from many primary Postgres databases.

More information on how Postgres logical replication works can be found in the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).

## Architecture

If your primary Postgres is hosted by a managed Postgres service, we recommend [deploying ParadeDB on Kubernetes](/deploy/self-hosted/k8s). To configure replication, please refer to [documentation for your managed Postgres service](/deploy/replication/managed).

If your primary Postgres is self-hosted, we recommend [installing the ParadeDB extension(s)](/deploy/self-hosted/extensions) directly in a replica within your cluster.

## Development

In development, we recommend [deploying ParadeDB with Docker](/deploy/self-hosted/docker).
