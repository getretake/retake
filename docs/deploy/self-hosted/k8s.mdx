The ParadeDB Helm Chart is based on the official [CloudNativePG Helm Chart](https://cloudnative-pg.io/). CloudNativePG is a Kubernetes operator that manages the full lifecycle of a highly available
PostgreSQL database cluster with a primary/standby architecture using Postgres streaming replication.

The chart is also available on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/paradedb/paradedb).

## Getting Started

First, install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). The following steps assume you have a Kubernetes cluster running v1.25+. If you are testing locally, we recommend
using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

### Install the CloudNativePG Operator

Skip this step if the CNPG operator is already installed in your cluster.

```bash
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --install cnpg \
--namespace cnpg-system \
--create-namespace \
cnpg/cloudnative-pg
```

### Set Up a ParadeDB CloudNativePG Cluster

Create a `values.yaml` and configure it to your requirements. Here is a basic example:

```yaml
type: paradedb
mode: standalone

cluster:
  instances: 2
  storage:
    size: 256Mi
```

Then, launch the ParadeDB cluster.

```bash
helm repo add paradedb https://paradedb.github.io/charts
helm upgrade --install paradedb \
--namespace paradedb-database \
--create-namespace \
--values values.yaml \
paradedb/paradedb
```

If `--values values.yaml`, the default values will be used. For additional configuration options, please refer to the [ParadeDB Helm Chart documentation](https://paradedb.github.io/charts/).

## High Availability

<Info>
  High availability is a ParadeDB enterprise feature. [Contact
  us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Info>

High availability, which is a deployment model that ensures minimal downtime through redundacy and failover mechanisms, can be configured for ParadeDB on Kubernetes via CloudNativePG. By default,
the ParadeDB CloudNativePG cluster will launch with 3 instances, one primary and two replica. To enable high availability for BM25 indexes, please contact [sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

For details on how high availability works in CloudNativePG, please refer to the [CloudNativePG documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/).
