title: High Availability
---

High availability (HA) minimizes downtime in the event of failures and is crucial for production deployments. To achieve high availability, you need to have
[ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) deployed inside a [CNPG Kubernetes cluster](/deploy/self-hosted/kubernetes).

## How High Availability Works

In a highly available configuration, ParadeDB deploys as a cluster of Postgres instances. One instance is designated as the **primary** while the other instances are designated as
**standby** instances. The primary server sends write-ahead logs (WAL) to the standby servers, which replicate the primary by replaying these logs.

If the primary server goes down, a standby server is promoted to become the new primary server. This process is called failover.

For a thorough architecture overview, please consult the [CloudNativePG Architecture documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/architecture/).

## Enable High Availability

Prior to starting the CNPG cluster, modify the `values.yaml` file to increase the number of instances.

```yaml ParadeDB Enterprise
type: paradedb-enterprise
mode: standalone

cluster:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 256Mi
```

The number of replicas is equal to `instances - 1`. Having at least `3` instances guarantees that a standby will be available even while a failover process is occurring.

## Configuration Options

### Replication

By default, ParadeDB ships with asynchronuous replication, meaning transactions on the primary **do not** wait for confirmation from
the standby instances before committing.

**Quorum-based synchronous replication** ensures that a transaction is successfully written to standbys before it completes.
Please consult the [CloudNativePG Replication documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/#synchronous-replication) for details.

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

ParadeDB supports backups to cloud object stores (e.g. S3, GCS, etc.) and point-in-time-recovery
via [Barman](https://pgbarman.org/). To configure the frequency and location of backups, please consult the [CloudNativePG Backup documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/backup_recovery/).
