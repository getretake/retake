title: Postgres Extensions
---

ParadeDB is built from two Postgres extensions

- The `pg_search` extension powers all of ParadeDB's [full text search API](/api-reference).
- The `pg_analytics` extension powers ParadeDB's [ingest API](/ingest).

This guide explains how to install `pg_search`, and optionally `pg_analytics`, inside an existing, self-hosted PostgreSQL database.

# Prerequisites

Ensure that you have superuser access to the Postgres database.

Next, install `libicu`.

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu70

# Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu74
```

# Install the ParadeDB Postgres Extensions

ParadeDB provides prebuilt binaries for our extensions on Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 for Postgres 14, 15 and 16 on both amd64 (x86_64) and arm64.
If you are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extensions from source.

## pg_search

To enable the ParadeDB full text search API inside a self-hosted PostgreSQL database, download and install the `pg_search` extension. The prebuilt releases can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest).

Note: You can replace `v0.10.2` with the `pg_search` version you wish to install, and `16` with the version of Postgres you are using.

## pg_analytics

To enable the ParadeDB ingest API inside a self-hosted PostgreSQL database, download and install the `pg_analytics` extension. The prebuilt releases can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics/releases/latest).

Note: You can replace `v0.1.4` with the `pg_analytics` version you wish to install, and `16` with the version of Postgres you are using.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu 24.04
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.1.4/postgresql-16-pg-analytics_0.1.4-1PARADEDB-noble_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash Ubuntu 22.04
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.1.4/postgresql-16-pg-analytics_0.1.4-1PARADEDB-jammy_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash Debian 12
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.1.4/postgresql-16-pg-analytics_0.1.4-1PARADEDB-bookworm_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb

```

```bash RHEL 9

# Available arch versions are x86_64, aarch64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.1.4/pg_analytics_16-0.1.4-1PARADEDB.el9.x86_64.rpm" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.rpm
sudo dnf install -y /tmp/*.rpm
```

```bash RHEL 8
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are x86_64, aarch64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.1.4/pg_analytics_16-0.1.4-1PARADEDB.el8.x86_64.rpm" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.rpm
sudo dnf install -y /tmp/*.rpm
```

</CodeGroup>

# Update `postgresql.conf`

Next, add the extension(s) to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

```conf
# If you only installed pg_search
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search'

# If you installed both pg_search and pg_analytics
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search,pg_analytics'
```

Reload your PostgreSQL server for these changes to take effect.

# Load the Extension

Finally, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_search;

-- If you installed pg_analytics
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```

That's it! You're all set to use ParadeDB APIs in your self-hosted Postgres database. To get started, we suggest you follow the [quickstart guide](/api-reference/getting-started/quickstart).

<Note>
  `pg_search` can be combined with `pgvector` for hybrid search. You can find
  the instructions for installing `pgvector`
  [here](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
