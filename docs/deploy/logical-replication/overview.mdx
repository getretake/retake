<Info>
  Deploying ParadeDB as a logical replication worker is a [ParadeDB
  Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) feature.
</Info>

In production, ParadeDB is designed to be deployed as a logical replica of your primary Postgres. This
allows ParadeDB to stay in sync with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, and Azure Postgres with zero additional
infrastructure overhead. It also isolates search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

Logical replication can be configured granularly to replicate specific tables or even rows/columns. Please see the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) for more details.
