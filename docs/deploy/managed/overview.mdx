title: Configure Replication
---

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, Azure Postgres, and others. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.
