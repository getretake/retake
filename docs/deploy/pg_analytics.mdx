This guide explains how to install the `pg_analytics` extension inside an existing PostgreSQL database. These
instructions are for deploying on Linux Debian/Ubuntu. If you are using a different version of Linux, please
[contact us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

# Prerequisites

Ensure that you have superuser access to the Postgres database.

# Install `pg_analytics`

ParadeDB provides prebuilt binaries for the `pg_analytics` extension for Postgres 14, 15 and 16 on Ubuntu 22.04. They can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest). If you
are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extension from source.

## Using Prebuilt Binaries

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.6.0/pg_analytics-v0.6.0-pg16-arm64-ubuntu2204.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

Note: You can replace `v0.6.0` with the `pg_analytics` version you wish to install, and `pg16` with the version of Postgres you are using.

## Building from Source

Please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/v0.6.0/pg_analytics#installation).

# Update `postgresql.conf`

Next, add `pg_analytics` to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

```conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_analytics'
```

Reload your PostgreSQL server for these changes to take effect.

# Load the Extension

Once the extension binary is installed on your system, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```
