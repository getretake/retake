# Deploying Using the ParadeDB Helm Chart

## Introduction:
Welcome to the ParadeDB Helm deployment guide! Helm is a powerful Kubernetes package manager that simplifies the deployment of applications in a Kubernetes cluster. This guide will walk you through deploying applications using the ParadeDB Helm chart.Prerequisites:

    A Kubernetes cluster up and running.
    Helm installed. If not, please refer to the official Helm documentation for installation guidelines.

## Deployment Steps:

**Step 1: Add the ParadeDB Helm Repository**
First, we need to add the ParadeDB repository to our Helm client. This repo contains all the necessary charts for ParadeDB.

```bash
helm repo add paradedb https://paradedb.github.io/helm-charts
```

**Step 2: Update the Helm Repository**

If you've previously added the ParadeDB repo, it's a good practice to update it to ensure you have the latest charts.

```bash
helm repo update
```

**Step 3: Search for the ParadeDB Chart**

Before installing, you can search for available charts in the ParadeDB repository to ensure you're installing the right one.

```bash
helm search repo paradedb
```

**Step 4: Install the ParadeDB Chart**

Now, let's deploy ParadeDB using the Helm chart. The helm install command will deploy the application in your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
helm install my-db paradedb/paradedb
```

<Note>my-db is a release name you choose. It will be used to identify pods, services, and any other Kubernetes resources</Note>

## Uninstallation Steps:

If for any reason you wish to uninstall the ParadeDB deployment, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
helm delete my-db
```

Remember to replace my-db with the release name you chose during installation.
