This section will guide you on how to deploy ParadeDB to an AWS instance. You need to have an AWS account, and optionally, the AWS CLI installed.

# Step-by-Step Guide

### Selecting an AWS EC2 Instance

**Instance Type**

The first step is to launch an EC2 instance. If you are looking for a production ready setup, we recommend storage-optimized instances like the `i3` or `d3` families.
If you are only testing or need a development setup, you can use a general-purpose instance like the `t3` or `m5` family.

**Storage**

We recommend you add storage to your instance using EBS volumes. Generally, for indexing and search its recommended to use fast SSD storage. For starting
out, general purpose storage will serve fine. However, if you are looking for a more performant setup, you can use provisioned iops volumes like `io1` and `io2`. The instance
needs at least 16GB of storage to install ParadeDB.

**AMI**

You can use any AMI, as long as you can install docker and docker compose to it.

After you have selected the right instance for your needs, you can launch an instance via the console using the "Launch instance" button,
or you can use the AWS CLI to do so.

**Networking**

Create an EC2 Security Group with an ingress rule on the port where ParadeDB will be exposed.

### Installing ParadeDB

**Step 1: Connect to the Instance**

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the *.pem file.
Connect to the instance using SSH:

```bash
ssh -i "your-key-file.pem" ubbuntu@your-instance-public-ip
```

**Step 2: Install Docker Engine on the Instance**


Update the installed packages and add the docker repository:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

Install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

Allow usage for non-root users:
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Activate changes on groups
newgrp docker
```

<Note>After adding the user to the Docker group, it's recommended to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.</Note>

**Step 3: Run the ParadeDB image**

Pull the ParadeDB Docker image:

```bash
docker run \
  -d \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

Verify the postgres server is running:
```bash
psql postgresql://your-user:your-password@your-instance-ip:5432/your-db
```

Make sure that your instance can accept connections on the TCP port where postgres is running.
