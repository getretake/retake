<Note>
  ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), a managed deployment of ParadeDB inside
  your AWS, Azure, or GCP account, is now available. Please [contact
  sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Note>

In production settings, we recommend deploying ParadeDB as a replica of your primary Postgres. This allows ParadeDB to
integrate with managed Postgres providers like AWS RDS, Google CloudSQL, and Azure Postgres. It also isolates
search and analytical workloads from your primary Postgres, which can prevent downtime caused by long-running queries.

When deployed as a replica, ParadeDB uses Postgres logical replication to stay in sync with your primary Postgres.
More information on how Postgres logical replication works can be found in the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html).
