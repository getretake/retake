title: ParadeDB BYOC
---

<Info>
  ParadeDB BYOC is a [ParadeDB Enterprise](/deploy/enterprise) feature. This
  guide assumes you are using a ParadeDB Enterprise build.
</Info>

ParadeDB BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) is a managed deployment of ParadeDB within your cloud environment. 
It combines the benefits of a managed platform with the security posture of a self-hosted deployment.

ParadeDB BYOC is supported on GCP and AWS, including GovCloud regions and airgapped environments.
To request access for Azure, Oracle Cloud, or another cloud platform please contact [sales@paradedb.com](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

## How BYOC Works

ParadeDB BYOC works by provisioning a ParadeDB Kubernetes cluster in your cloud environment via infrastructure-as-code. The BYOC module is configured via a simple configuration
file and automates [high availability](/deploy/self-hosted/high-availability) configuration and [logical replication](/deploy/self-hosted/logical-replication) integration with
existing Postgres managed service(s). The BYOC module ships with integrated backups, connection pooling, monitoring, access control, and audit logging.

ParadeDB BYOC deployment and support is available as one of two options:

- **Fully Managed** Under this deployment mode, the ParadeDB team will deploy and manage the ParadeDB BYOC module on your behalf. In order to proceed with this deployment mode, you will
  need to provide access to a sub-account or project within your cloud provider via an IAM user or a service account.

- **Just-in-Time Managed** Under this deployment mode, you will deploy the ParadeDB BYOC module and can optionally provide just-in-time access to the ParadeDB team when hands-on support is required. This
  deployment mode is optimal for airgapped environment where providing external access to even a subset of your cloud environment is undesirable.

## Getting Started

This section assumes you are deploying the ParadeDB BYOC module yourself. If you are not, this will be handled by the ParadeDB team. The following commands must be executed from
within your BYOC module repository.

### Installing Dependencies

To get started, install Terraform, Kubectl, PostgreSQL, and the CLI for your desired cloud provider:

```bash
# macOS
brew install terraform kubectl postgresql

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y terraform kubectl postgresql
```

Instructions for installing the AWS CLI can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and for installing the GCP CLI can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#deb).

### Authenticating your Cloud Provider

#### Setting up AWS

If you want to deploy to AWS, authenticate by following the prompts and providing your AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Key.

```bash
aws configure
```

#### Setting up GCP

If you want to deploy to GCP, authenticate by following the prompts and creating or providing your GCP project and access credentials.

```bash
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Provisioning the ParadeDB infrastructure

Our Terraform project will provision for you a Kubernetes cluster (EKS or GKE) along with all the necessary infrastructure to run ParadeDB on it.

To start, from within the `aws/` or `gcp/` subfolder, copy the `byoc.example.tfvars` file to `byoc.tfvars` and customize it with your own configuration. Instructions for configuring each file can be found directly in the file.

```bash
# AWS
cp aws.example.tfvars byoc.tfvars

# GCP
cp gcp.example.tfvars byoc.tfvars

# Open and customize the file
open byoc.tfvars || xdg-open byoc.tfvars
```

#### Running Terraform

To get started you need to initialize Terraform, which will install all the required Terraform integrations.

```bash
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/aws init
# or
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/gcp init
```

To apply the infrastructure, simply run `apply`. It will execute the actions proposed in the `plan` step. There should
not be any manual intervention required, but if an error seems spurious simply re-run `apply`.

```bash
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/aws apply -var-file=../../byoc.tfvars
# or
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/gcp apply -var-file=../../byoc.tfvars
```

Note that the first apply may take up to ~30 minutes to provision all the necessary infrastructure.

### Removing the ParadeDB infrastructure

To remove the ParadeDB infrastructure, you can use Terraform to destroy all the resources it provisioned.

```bash
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/aws destroy -var-file=../../byoc.tfvars
# or
terraform -chdir=infrastructure/gcp destroy -var-file=../../byoc.tfvars
```

### Accessing the ParadeDB Cluster

First, run the `kubectl` command printed as Terraform output to the terminal to add the EKS or GKE cluster configuration to your local `.kubeconfig` file.

#### Accessing the Grafana Dashboard

1. Port-forward the Grafana service to localhost via:

```bash
kubectl --namespace monitoring port-forward service/prometheus-grafana 8080:80
```

2. Go to `http://localhost:8080` and provide the Grafana credentials printed as Terraform output to the terminal.

You can find the ParadeDB dashboard by typing `CloudNativePG` in the search bar, and selecting `paradedb` for the Database Namespace. By default, the dashboard will display metrics over the last 7 days. If you've just spun up the cluster, change it to the last 15 minutes to start seeing results immediately.

#### Accessing the ParadeDB Database

1. Retrieve the database credentials via:

```bash
kubectl --namespace paradedb get secrets paradedb-superuser -o json | jq -r '.data | map_values(@base64d)'
```

2. Port-forward the ParadeDB service to localhost via:

```bash
kubectl --namespace paradedb port-forward service/paradedb-rw 5432:5432
```

3. Connect to the ParadeDB database via the credentials retrieved:

```bash
PGPASSWORD=<your-password> psql -h localhost -d paradedb -p 5432 -U <your-user>
```

You can also connect with your favorite PostgreSQL client.
