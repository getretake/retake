title: pg_search
---

The `pg_search` extension powers all of ParadeDB's full text search capabilities.

This guide explains how to install `pg_search` inside an existing PostgreSQL database. These
instructions are for deploying on Linux Debian/Ubuntu. If you are using a different version of Linux, please
[contact us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

# Prerequisites

First, ensure that you have superuser access to the Postgres database.

Next, install `libicu`.

```bash
# Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu70

# Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu74
```

# Install `pg_search`

ParadeDB provides prebuilt binaries for the `pg_search` extension on Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 for Postgres 14, 15 and 16 on both amd64 (x86_64) and arm64. They can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest). If you
are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extension from source.

## Using Prebuilt Binaries

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu 24.04
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.9.4/postgresql-16-pg-search_0.9.4-1PARADEDB-noble_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_search.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash Ubuntu 22.04
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.9.4/postgresql-16-pg-search_0.9.4-1PARADEDB-jammy_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_search.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash Debian 12
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.9.4/postgresql-16-pg-search_0.9.4-1PARADEDB-bookworm_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_search.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash RHEL 9
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are x86_64, aarch64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.9.4/pg_search_16-0.9.4-1PARADEDB.el9.x86_64.rpm" -o /tmp/pg_search.rpm
sudo dnf install -y /tmp/*.rpm
```

```bash RHEL 8
# Available Postgres version are 14, 15, 16
# Available arch versions are x86_64, aarch64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.9.4/pg_search_16-0.9.4-1PARADEDB.el8.x86_64.rpm" -o /tmp/pg_search.rpm
sudo dnf install -y /tmp/*.rpm
```

Note: You can replace `v0.9.4` with the `pg_search` version you wish to install, and `16` with the version of Postgres you are using.

## Building from Source

Please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/v0.9.4/pg_search#installation).

# Update `postgresql.conf`

Next, add `pg_search` to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

```conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search'
```

Reload your PostgreSQL server for these changes to take effect.

# Load the Extension

Once the extension binary is installed on your system, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_search;
```

That's it! You're all set to use `pg_search` in your database. To get started, we suggest you follow the [quickstart guide](/welcome/quickstart).

<Note>
  `pg_search` can be combined with `pgvector` for hybrid search. You can find
  the instructions for installing `pgvector`
  [here](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
