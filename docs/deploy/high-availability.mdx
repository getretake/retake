title: High Availability
---

<Info>
  High availability is a ParadeDB enterprise feature. [Contact
  us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Info>

High availability, which is a deployment model that ensures minimal downtime through redundacy and failover mechanisms, can be configured for ParadeDB on Kubernetes via CloudNativePG. By default,
the ParadeDB CloudNativePG cluster will launch with 3 instances, one primary and two replica. To enable high availability for BM25 indexes, please contact [sales](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

For details on how high availability works in CloudNativePG, please refer to the [CloudNativePG documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/).
