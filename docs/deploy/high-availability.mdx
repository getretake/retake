<Info>
  High availability is a ParadeDB enterprise feature. [Contact us](mailto:sales@paradedb.com) for access.
</Info>

In production settings, we recommend deploying your ParadeDB cluster configured with high
availability (HA) to minimize downtime. ParadeDB supports high availability as part of our
[Kubernetes deployment](/deploy/self-hosted/k8s), with CloudNativePG.

## What is High Availability?

High availability is the ability of a database to operate continousouly and reliably, with minimal
or no downtime. To accomplish this, ParadeDB deploys as a cluster of instances, by default 3, which replicate
data between each other. One instance is designed as the **primary** while the other instances are designed as
**standby** instances. The standby instances can seamlessly be failed-over to should the primary instance start
to malfunction, which helps prevent downtime due to load or hardware failures.

## How Does It Work?

High availability in ParadeDB is built via Postgres physical replication, also known as streaming replication. Note that
physical/streaming replication is **different** from [logical replication](#high-availability-vs-logical-replication).

Physical replication is one of the strengths of PostgreSQL and one of the reasons why some of the
largest organizations in the world have chosen it for the management of their data in business
continuity contexts. Primarily used to achieve high availability, physical replication also
allows scale-out of read-only workloads and offloading of some work from the primary.

In ParadeDB, Postgres native physical replication is integrated directly in the Kubernetes API. This
design greatly simplifies management and increases failover and autoscaling responsiveness. It also
enables maintaining standby instances across multiple datacenter availability zones or regions,
to mitigate downtime caused by natural disasters.

For more details on multi-availability zone ParadeDB Kubernetes clusters, please consult the [CloudNativePG Architecture documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/architecture/).

### Synchronous Replication

By default, ParadeDB ships with asynchronuous replication, meaning transactions on the primary **do not** wait for confirmation from
the standby instances before committing. This is the simplest form of high availability.

It is possible to configure **quorum-based synchronous replication**. This can improve data consistency further by ensuring
that a transaction is written to multiple nodes before it is considered complete.

For more details on synchronous replication, please consult the [CloudNativePG Replication documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/#synchronous-replication).

### Continuous Backup

ParadeDB supports backups to cloud object stores (e.g. S3, GCS, etc.) and point-in-time-recovery
via [Barman](https://pgbarman.org/). To further reduce the risk of data loss, continuous backups can
be configured when using ParadeDB on Kubernetes. This enables the ParadeDB standbys to fallback on archived
database records whenever replication from the primary fails.

For more details on continuous backups, please consult the [CloudNativePG Backup documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/backup_recovery/).

### Security

By default, a ParadeDB Kubernetes cluster launches with one primary and two
replicas, replicating the state of the primary between each other via a preconfigured
Postgres user called `streaming_replica`. Replication is performed over an encrypted channel
and enforces TLS client certificate authentication for the `streaming_replica` user.

For more details on security configurations for Postgres physical replication, please consult the [CloudNativePG Replication documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/replication/).

## Physical Replication vs Logical Replication

[Logical replication](/deploy/replication/overview) is used to connect the primary instance of a ParadeDB cluster as a replica to an existing Postgres deployment, for instance
on a managed Postgres service like AWS RDS. It replicates specific data changes by tracking and transmitting individual row modifications. This feature is fully supported in the
open source version of ParadeDB.

Physical replication is used to achieve high availability between instances within a ParadeDB cluster. It copies entire data files byte-for-byte
on disk. This feature is reserved for ParadeDB enterprise customers.
