High availability (HA) minimizes downtime in the event of failures and is crucial for production deployments.
ParadeDB's [Kubernetes deployment](/deploy/high-availability/getting-started) supports high availability and is transparently managed by CloudNativePG.

## How High Availability Works

In a highly available configuration, ParadeDB deploys as a cluster of Postgres instances. One instance is designated as the **primary** while the other instances are designated as
**standby** instances. The primary server sends write-ahead logs (WAL) to the standby servers, which replicate the primary by replaying these logs. CloudNativePG calls this physical replication based on WAL shipping.

If the primary server goes down, a standby server is promoted to become the new primary server. This process is called failover.

For a thorough architecture overview, please consult the [CloudNativePG Architecture documentation](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.18/architecture/).
