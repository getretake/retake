This topic covers how to quickly import data from an existing Postgres database or CSV file into ParadeDB.

## From Postgres

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Ensure that you have `psql` installed on your machine. This will provide the necessary 
  `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` command line utilities.
</Info>

From your terminal, run `pg_dump` to create a copy of your existing database.

```
pg_dump -Fc --no-acl --no-owner \
    -h <host> \
    -U <username> \
    <db_name> > old_db.dump
```
