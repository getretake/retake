title: Aggregations Explained
---

Aggregations are a way to perform analytics on your SQL data. While Postgres provides aggregations, these
operations can take upwards of several minutes. ParadeDB leverage's Tantivy fast fields to perform
lightning-fast aggregations on individual columns.

There are two types of aggregations: bucket and metrics. Bucket aggregations are useful for categorizing
and grouping data. Supported bucket aggregations are `Histogram`, `Range`, and `Terms`.
Supported metrics aggregations are `Average`, `Count`, `Max`, `Min`, `Stats`, `Sum`, and `Percentiles`.
