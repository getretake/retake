title: Bucket Aggregations
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Aggregations can only be performed over fields [indexed as
  fast fields](/indexing/bm25).
</Info>

## Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT *
FROM paradedb.aggregation('<index_name>', '<aggregation_query>');
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
SELECT *
FROM paradedb.aggregation(
    'mock_items',
    '{"aggs": {"histogram": {"field": "rating", "interval": 2}}}'
)
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name">The name of the index.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="aggregation_query">
  The aggregation query string. Aggregation query strings follow the
  ElasticSearch DSL.
</ParamField>

## Bucket Aggregation JSON Format

### Histogram

The `Histogram` aggregation returns a list of buckets, each representing a specific range of values in the
aggregated field.

```sql
'{
    "histogram": {
        "field": "rating",
        "interval": 2
    }
}'
```

<Expandable title="Config Options">

<ParamField body="field" required type="string">
  The name of the field to aggregate.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="interval" required type="int">
  The interval to chunk your data range. Must be a positive value.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="offset" type="int">
  Shifts the grid of buckets from `[interval * k, interval * (k + 1))` to
  `[offset + interval * k, offset + interval * (k + 1))`. Must be in `[0,
  interval)`. Example: For documents with values `9` and `12`, interval `10.0`,
  they fall into buckets `0` and `10`. With offset `5`, both fall into bucket
  `5`, range `[5..15)`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="min_doc_count" type="int">
  Sets the minimum document count per bucket for inclusion in results. Defaults
  to `0`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="hard_bounds" type="{'min': int, 'max': int}">
  Constrains data to the `[min, max]` interval. Filters out values outside this
  range. To enforce a specific range, set both `extended_bounds` and
  `hard_bounds` to identical ranges.
</ParamField>

</Expandable>

### Range

The `Range` aggregation categorizes documents into specified value ranges, providing a count per range and
enabling a clear, segmented view of data distribution across defined boundaries.

```sql
'{
    "range": {
        "field": "rating",
        "ranges": [
            { "to": 3.0 },
            { "from": 3.0, "to": 7.0 }
        ]
    }
}'
```

<Expandable title="Config Options">

<ParamField body="field" required type="string">
  The name of the field to aggregate.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ranges" required type="{'to': int, 'from': int}[]">
  Note that this aggregation includes the from value and excludes the to value
  for each range. Extra buckets will be created until the first to, and last
  from, if necessary.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="keyed" type="bool">
  Whether to return the buckets as a hash map.
</ParamField>

</Expandable>

### Terms

The `Terms` aggregation creates a bucket for every unique term and counts the number of occurences.

```sql
'{
    "terms": {
        "field": "description"
    }
}'
```

<Expandable title="Config Options">

<ParamField body="field" required type="string">
  The field to aggregate on.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="size" type="int">
  The number of terms to return. Defaults to the top 10 terms with the most documents. Larger values for size are more expensive.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="split_size" type="int">
  Unused by tantivy.

Since tantivy doesn’t know shards, this parameter is merely there to be used by consumers of tantivy. `shard_size` is the number of terms returned by each shard. The default value in Elasticsearch is `size * 1.5 + 10`.

Should never be smaller than `size`.

</ParamField>
<ParamField body="segment_size" type="int">
  To get more accurate results, we fetch more than `size` from each segment. Increasing this value will increase the cost for more accuracy. Defaults to `10 * size`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="show_term_doc_count_error" type="bool">
  If you set the `show_term_doc_count_error` parameter to true, the terms
  aggregation will include `doc_count_error_upper_bound`, which is an upper
  bound to the error on the `doc_count` returned by each shard. It’s the sum of
  the size of the largest bucket on each segment that didn’t fit into
  `shard_size`. Defaults to true when ordering by count desc.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="min_doc_count" type="int">
  Filter out all terms with a count lower than `min_doc_count`. Defaults to 1.

Note: Setting this to 0 will return all terms in the field, but it can be expensive.

</ParamField>
<ParamField body="missing" type="string">
  Defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. 
  By default, they are ignored, but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.
  For example, `"NO_DATA"`.
</ParamField>
