## What is HNSW?

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is an algorithm used for efficient approximate nearest neighbor
search in high-dimensional spaces. It constructs a multi-layered graph structure, where each layer is a
subset of the previous one, enabling faster navigation through the data points. This approach allows
HNSW to achieve state-of-the-art search speed and accuracy, especially for large-scale datasets.

ParadeDB uses the `pgvector` HNSW index, which offers a significant performance boost over the original
IVFFlat `pgvector` index.

## Creating a HNSW Index

The following command creates a BM25 index over a column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON <schema_name>.<table_name>
USING hnsw (<column_name> <distance_metric>);
```

<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema, or namespace, of the table. The schema name only needs
  to be provided if the table is not in the `public` schema.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="column_name" required>
  The name of the column being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance_metric" required>
  The distance metric used for measuring similarity between two vectors. Use
  `vector_l2_ops` for L2 distance, `vector_ip_ops` for inner product, and
  `vector_cosine_ops` for cosine distance.
</ParamField>

Additional HNSW parameters are listed in the [`pgvector` documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hnsw).

## Deleting a HNSW Index

The following command deletes a HNSW index:

```sql
DROP INDEX <index_name>;
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>

## Recreating a HNSW Index

Like a BM25 index, an HNSW index only needs to be recreated if the name of the indexed column changes.
To recreate the index, simply delete and create it using the SQL commands above.
