## pg_search

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `rank_hybrid` would not work when using custom key field names.

## pg_sparse

With the release of `v0.7.0`, sparse vector support was added to `pgvector`. As a result, we have
deprecated `pg_sparse` in favour of the upstream `pgvector` implementation.

## ParadeDB

### New Features

- Users can now enable basic High Availability (HA) for the ParadeDB Bitnami Postgres Docker image.
