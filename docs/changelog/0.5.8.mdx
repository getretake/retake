## pg_analytics

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where statements like `ALTER TABLE <table> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` were failing on heap tables due to them being intercepted by `parquet` tables.
- Fixed a bug where table rows appeared in reversed order in SELECT statements
- Significantly improve INSERT performance by using transaction callbacks to flush at the end of the INSERT statement

## pg_bm25

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `TRUNCATE` would break BM25 indexes.
- Fixed a bug where memory consumption would increase significantly when indexing large tables.
- Fixed a bug where `rank_hybrid` was not working with schemas not on the `search_path`.
- Fixed a bug where deleting Tantivy files occasionally failed.

### New Features

- Added support for "query builders", which can be used to build complex queries that harness the full power of Tantivy.

## pg_sparse

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where serializing/deserializing large vectors (length greater than 65536) would result in dropped values.

## ParadeDB

### Bitnami PostgresSQL Docker Image

- Converted the ParadeDB base Docker image to Bitnami PostgreSQL, based on Debian 11 and Postgres 16. This provides higher security guarantees, enables logical replication, and adds support for `pgaudit` and `postgis` Postgres extensions.
- Added the `pg_cron` extension to the ParadeDB Docker image, which allows scheduling periodic jobs in PostgreSQL.
