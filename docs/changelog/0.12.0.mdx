## New Features 💡

### JSON Syntax

- [#1811](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1811) introduced the ability to pass JSON objects directly to the search query, similar to Elasticsearch's Query DSL. The documentation has been updated to reflect this new query syntax option.

### Index Configuration

- [#1883](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1883) introduced the ability for users to adjust a BM25 index's performance based on their hardware and requirements, and can be found [here](/documentation/configuration/index#index-configuration-settings).

## Performance Improvements 🚀

### Incredibly Fast Aggregates

- This release introduces efficient handling of aggregate queries (e.g. `COUNT(<field>)`, `SUM(<field>)`, etc.), where `<field>` is indexed as a fast field. This [optimization](/documentation/aggregates/overview) is automatically applied by the query planner when these queries are executed. This functionality is available in ParadeDB Enterprise.

## Stability Improvements 💪

- `0.11.1` introduced a regression where BM25 scores and snippets leaked some memory and added some performance overhead. This has been fixed, leading to an almost 2x performance improvement.

- [#1881](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1881) fixes a bug where users could configure the index writing memory limit to exceed that of our underlying search engine.

- [#1893](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1893) makes `ALTER` and `DROP` commands more ergonomic by removing the `bm25_index` suffix from BM25 indexes.

## Docker Image 🐳

- The ParadeDB Docker image now ships with tags for all major versions of Postgres. They can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/paradedb/paradedb/tags).
- The ParadeDB Docker image now ships with `pgvector` version `0.8.0`.
