## New Features 💡

### JSON Syntax

[#1811](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1811) introduced the ability to pass JSON objects directly to the search query, similar to Elasticsearch's Query DSL. The documentation has been updated to reflect this new query syntax option.

## Performance Improvements 🚀

### Fast Aggregates

Our first milestone in accelerating aggregates like `COUNT` has landed in ParadeDB Enterprise.
In this optimization, fields indexed as [fast fields](/documentation/indexing/fast_fields) are read in columnar bathces instead of
being read one-by-one, which drastically improves query times over large result sets. We're seeing a ~25X speedup on our test
`COUNT` queries that return 100 million rows.

The second milestone is to parallelize these queries, which we expect to deliver an additional ~10X speedup depending on the hardware of the host machine.
This optimization will land in the next enterprise release.

### Improved Index Merge Policy

Under the hood, the BM25 index is actually made up of mini indexes called segments. Because multiple threads read from segments in parallel during a search, having
significantly more segments than number of available CPUs can negatively impact search performance.

[#1883](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1883) changes the segment merge policy (which automatically runs on `INSERT` and `VACUUM`) to target the number of
CPUs on the machine. This can be configured in the index settings.

## Stability Improvements 💪

- `0.11.1` introduced a regression where BM25 scores and snippets leaked memory. This has been fixed and we're seeing a 2X speedup over scoring/snippet queries.

- [#1881](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1881) makes sure that `paradedb.create_index_memory_budget` does not exceed Tantivy's hard-coded 4GB limit.

- [#1893](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/pull/1893) makes `ALTER` and `DROP` commands more ergonomic by removing the `bm25_index` suffix from BM25 indexes.
