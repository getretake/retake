### Row Level Security

Row level security (RLS) is a feature that allows you to control which users are permitted to perform
read and write statements on specific rows.

By default, RLS is enabled over heap tables. RLS over `parquet` tables is a commerical feature. Please
contact us [here](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).

### Deep Storage

Deep storage is a commerical feature that allows you to write `parquet` tables to an external object
store like S3. Please contact us [here](mailto:sales@paradedb.com).
