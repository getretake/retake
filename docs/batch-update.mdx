title: "Send a Batch Update"
---

A batch update reads every single row or document from your source, embeds it, and upserts it into your sink. This is an
expensive and time-consuming operation and should only be run at scheduled intervals. If your embeddings use a third-party
API like OpenAI, please be cognizant of query limits.

A batch update will not delete any documents in your sink, but if there is a document with the same ID and field name in
your sink, it will be overriden with the new value.

Running a batch update is a single line of code:

```bash main.py
# This could take a while, depending on your table size and embedding model
pipeline.pipe_once(verbose=True)
```
