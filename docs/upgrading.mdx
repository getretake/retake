title: Updating ParadeDB
---

## Overview

ParadeDB ships all of its functionality via Postgres extensions. All updates to ParadeDB can be
received by updating one or more of the following extensions:

1. `pg_bm25` for full text search
2. `pgvector` for dense vector search
3. `pg_sparse` for sparse vector search

## Getting the Current Version

To inspect the current version of an extension, run the following command.

```sql
SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = '<extension_name>';
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">
  ```sql SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_bm25'; ```
</Accordion>

## Updating to a New Version

If a new version of `pg_bm25` or `pg_sparse` is available, it will be listed in the [changelog](/latest/changelog).
Here, you can view the changes made and decide if you want to upgrade. Note that some updates may alter an
extension's API interface.

The latest `pg_bm25` and `pg_sparse` will always be pegged to the same version. `pgvector`, on the other hand, is
created and maintained outside of ParadeDB, so it maintains its own version. Users should refer to the `pgvector`
[README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for documentation on its latest changes.

### From ParadeDB Cloud

Run the following command to upgrade to a specific version of an extension.

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO '<version_number>';
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">
  ```sql ALTER EXTENSION pg_bm25 UPDATE TO '0.4.1'; ```
</Accordion>

### From ParadeDB Docker Image

Run the following command to pull a specific version of the Docker Image. You can set the version number
to `latest` to pull the latest Docker image.

```bash
docker pull paradedb/paradedb:<version_number>
```

### From Self-Managed Postgres

First, download and install the extension you wish to upgrade in the same way that it was initially
installed. Then, run

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE TO '<version_number>';
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">
  ```sql ALTER EXTENSION pg_bm25 UPDATE TO '0.4.1'; ```
</Accordion>
