title: Hybrid Search
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, please
  ensure that you have created both BM25 and HNSW indexes.

## Overview

Hybrid search, which combines BM25-based full text scores with vector-based
similarity scores, is especially useful in scenarios where you want to match by both
exact keywords and semantic meaning.

## Basic Usage

To calculate a row's hybrid score, ParadeDB introduces a `paradedb.weighted_mean` function.

```sql
SELECT
    description,
    category,
    rating,
    paradedb.weighted_mean(
        paradedb.minmax_bm25(ctid, '[index_name]', '[query]'),
        1 - paradedb.minmax_norm(
          [l2_distance],
          MIN([l2_distance]) OVER (),
          MAX([l2_distance]) OVER ()
        ),
        [weights]
    ) as score_hybrid
FROM [table_name]
ORDER BY score_hybrid DESC;
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the BM25 index associated with this table. For instance, if you
  ran `CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table USING bm25 ((my_table.*))`, the index
  name would be `'my_index'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The full text search query. For instance, `'description:keyboard'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="l2_distance" required>
  The L2 distance between two vectors. Supports distance operators like 
  `'[1,2,3] <-> embedding'`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="weights" required>
  An array of length 2. The first element of the array is the weight assigned to
  the first argument of `paradedb.weighted_mean`. The two weights must be
  between `0` and `1` and add up to `1`. For instance, `ARRAY[0.5,0.5]` applies
  an equal weight to both scores.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table.
</ParamField>
