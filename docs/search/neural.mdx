## Basic Usage

The `neuralQuery` function performs neural (keyword + semantic) search. Results returned by this function will
be scored both on semantic meaning and keyword matching.

The function takes two arguments: the query and the field names to search over.

```bash
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answer"]

Search().neuralQuery(query, fields)
```
