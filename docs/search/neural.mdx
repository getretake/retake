title: Neural Search
---

## Prerequisite

Neural search returns search results that are scored on both semantic meaning and keyword matching.

Neural search is only enabled over fields that have been vectorized. Once a field is vectorized, it does not
need to be vectorized again. Retake guarantees that vectors are cached and kept in sync.

```
fields_to_vectorize = ["questions", "answers"]
index.vectorize(fields_to_vectorize)
```

## Basic Usage

Once fields are vectorized, they can be searched with the `neuralQuery` function. This function takes two arguments:
the query and the field names to search over.

```python
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answer"]

Search().neuralQuery(query, fields)
```
