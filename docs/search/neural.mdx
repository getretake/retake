title: Semantic + Neural Search
---

Semantic search, using HNSW, understands the semantic meaning of your query and finds results that are contextually
relevant. Neural search combines this semantic understanding with keyword-based BM25 search.

## Prerequisite

Before semantic and neural search can be performed over a field, the field must first be vectorized. Once vectorized,
a field does not need to be vectorized again â€” Retake ensures that vectors are properly cached and kept in sync.

```python
fields_to_vectorize = ["questions", "answers"]
index.vectorize(fields_to_vectorize)
```

## Semantic Search

The `with_semantic` function takes two arguments: the query and the field names to search over. It returns results
whose vectors are most similar to the vectorized query:

```python
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answer"]

Search().with_semantic(query, fields)
```

## Neural Search

The `with_neural` function takes the same arguments as `with_semantic`. It returns results with the highest combined
semantic and keyword-based scores:

```python
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answer"]

Search().with_neural(query, fields)
```
