## Basic Usage

The `neuralQuery` function performs neural (keyword + semantic) search. The function takes two arguments: the
query and the column names to search over.

```bash
query = "Who am I?"
columns = ["question", "answer"]
table_name = "faqs"

client.search(
    table_name,
    Search().neuralQuery(query, columns)
)
```
