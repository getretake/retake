title: Quickstart
---

<Note>
  This quickstart covers the latest version of ParadeDB, which is a sigificant
  API refactor compared to versions of ParadeDB below v0.4. Users below v0.4
  must upgrade to the latest version, as the old documentation has been
  deprecated.
</Note>

This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with ParadeDB for search:

1. Full text search
2. Similarity (i.e. vector) search
3. Hybrid search

## Full Text Search

ParadeDB comes with a helpful procedure that creates a table populated with mock data to help
you get started. Once connected with `psql`, run the following commands to create and inspect
this table.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25_test_table(
  schema_name => 'public',
  table_name => 'mock_items'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ```csv description | rating | category
  --------------------------+--------+------------- Ergonomic metal keyboard | 4
  | Electronics Plastic Keyboard | 4 | Electronics Sleek running shoes | 5 |
  Footwear (3 rows) ```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create a BM25 index called `search_idx` on this table. We'll index the
`description` and `category` fields and configure the tokenizer on the `description` field.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
        index_name => 'search_idx',
        schema_name => 'public',
        table_name => 'mock_items',
        key_field => 'id',
        text_fields => '{description: {tokenizer: {type: "en_stem"}}, category: {}}'
);
```

Note the mandatory `key_field` option. Every BM25 index needs a `key_field`, which should
be the name of a column that will function as a row's unique identifier within the index. Usually, the `key_field`
can just be the name of your table's primary key column.

<Note>
Currently, only integer IDs are supported in the `key_field` column, so if your primary key is a composite
or a string, just add another column with serial IDs to your table and use that as your `key_field`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items
ADD COLUMN bm25_id SERIAL;
```

</Note>

We're now ready to execute a full-text search. We'll look for rows where `description` matches the `shoes` or
`category` matches `electronics`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search('description:keyboard OR category:electronics')
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | rating | category
  -----------------------------+--------+------------- Plastic Keyboard | 4 |
  Electronics Ergonomic metal keyboard | 4 | Electronics Innovative wireless
  earbuds | 5 | Electronics Fast charging power bank | 4 | Electronics
  Bluetooth-enabled speaker | 3 | Electronics (5 rows) ```
</Accordion>

Next, let's see how ParadeDB handles a phrase query like `bluetooth speaker`. Let's also surface results even
if there is a word between `bluetooth` and `speaker`.

```sql
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM search_idx.search('description:"bluetooth speaker"~1')
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | rating | category
  ---------------------------+--------+------------- Bluetooth-enabled speaker |
  3 | Electronics (1 row) ```
</Accordion>

Note that phrases must be wrapped in double quotes. Also note our use of the `~1` slop operator,
which tells ParadeDB to return matches even if they are separated by `1` word.

Next, let's match against a partial word like `blue`. To
do this, we'll create a new index that uses the `ngrams` tokenizer,
which splits text into chunks of size `n`.

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
        index_name => 'ngrams_idx',
        schema_name => 'public',
        table_name => 'mock_items',
        key_field => 'id',
        text_fields => '{description: {tokenizer: {type: "ngram", min_gram: 4, max_gram: 4, prefix_only: false}}, category: {}}'
);

SELECT description, rating, category
FROM ngrams_idx.search('description:blue');
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | rating | category
  ---------------------------+--------+------------- Bluetooth-enabled speaker |
  3 | Electronics (1 row) ```
</Accordion>

Finally, let's examine the BM25 scores and generate highlighted snippets for our results.

```sql
SELECT s.description, h.highlight_bm25, r.rank_bm25 FROM ngrams_idx.search('description:blue') as s
LEFT JOIN ngrams_idx.highlight('description:blue', highlight_field => 'description') as h ON s.id = h.id
LEFT JOIN ngrams_idx.rank('description:blue') as r ON s.id = r.id;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | highlight_bm25 | rank_bm25
  ---------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------
  Bluetooth-enabled speaker | <b>Blue</b>tooth-enabled speaker | 2.9903657 (1
  row) ```
</Accordion>

ParadeDB supports a variety of additional full text search features like [fuzzy search](/latest/search/fuzzy),
[autocomplete](/latest/search/autocomplete),and [multi-language tokenizers](/latest/indexing/bm25#tokenizers).

## Similarity Search

For vector similarity search, let's first generate a vector embeddings column. For the sake of this tutorial, we'll
randomly generate these embeddings.

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN embedding vector(3);

UPDATE mock_items m
SET embedding = ('[' ||
    ((m.id + 1) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 2) % 10 + 1)::integer || ',' ||
    ((m.id + 3) % 10 + 1)::integer || ']')::vector;

SELECT description, rating, category, embedding
FROM mock_items
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | rating | category | embedding
  --------------------------+--------+-------------+----------- Ergonomic metal
  keyboard | 4 | Electronics | [3,4,5] Plastic Keyboard | 4 | Electronics |
  [4,5,6] Sleek running shoes | 5 | Footwear | [5,6,7] (3 rows) ```
</Accordion>

Next, let's create an HNSW index on the `embedding` column of our table.
While not required, an HNSW index can drastically improve query performance over very large datasets.

```sql
CREATE INDEX on mock_items
USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

Next, let's query our table with a vector and order the results by L2 distance:

```sql
SELECT description, category, rating, embedding
FROM mock_items
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1,2,3]'
LIMIT 3;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | category | rating | embedding
  -------------------------+------------+--------+----------- Artistic ceramic
  vase | Home Decor | 4 | [1,2,3] Modern wall clock | Home Decor | 4 | [1,2,3]
  Designer wall paintings | Home Decor | 5 | [1,2,3] (3 rows) ```
</Accordion>

## Hybrid Search

Finally, let's implement hybrid search, which combines BM25-based full text scores with vector-based
similarity scores. Hybrid search is especially useful in scenarios where you want to match by both
exact keywords and semantic meaning.

The `rank_hybrid` function accepts a BM25 query and a similarity query. It applies minmax normalization to the BM25 and
similarity scores and combines them using a weighted average.

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.rank_hybrid(
    bm25_query => 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics',
    similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
    bm25_weight => 0.9,
    similarity_weight => 0.1
) LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv id | rank_hybrid ----+------------- 2 | 0.95714283 1 | 0.8487012 29 |
  0.1 39 | 0.1 9 | 0.1 (5 rows) ```
</Accordion>

Let's join this result with our `mock_items` table to see the full results of our hybrid search:

```sql
SELECT m.description, m.category, m.embedding, s.rank_hybrid
FROM mock_items m
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT * FROM search_idx.rank_hybrid(
        bm25_query => 'description:keyboard OR category:electronics',
        similarity_query => '''[1,2,3]'' <-> embedding',
        bm25_weight => 0.9,
        similarity_weight => 0.1
    )
) s
ON m.id = s.id
LIMIT 5;
```

<Accordion title="Expected Response">
  ``` csv description | category | embedding | rank_hybrid
  --------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------- Plastic
  Keyboard | Electronics | [4,5,6] | 0.95714283 Ergonomic metal keyboard |
  Electronics | [3,4,5] | 0.8487012 Designer wall paintings | Home Decor |
  [1,2,3] | 0.1 Handcrafted wooden frame | Home Decor | [1,2,3] | 0.1 Modern
  wall clock | Home Decor | [1,2,3] | 0.1 (5 rows) ```
</Accordion>

As we can see, results with the word `keyboard` scored higher than results with an embedding of
`[1,2,3]` because we placed a weight of `0.9` on the BM25 scores.

<Note>
  Minmax normalization transforms the lowest and highest scores in a dataset to
  `0` and `1`, respectively. Because of this, the lowest-ranking BM25 or
  similarity score may be overlooked, as it is transformed to `0`.
</Note>

## Congratulations!

You've now seen how ParadeDB serves as both a Postgres database and search engine.
