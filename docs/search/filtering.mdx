title: Filtering
---

The `filter` function can be used to retrieve exactly the results that match filters.

## String Filtering

```bash
Search().filter("term", answer="Michael")
```

## Numeric Filtering

The `range` operator supports the following options:

- `gte`: Greater-than or equal to
- `gt`: Greater-than
- `lte`: Less-than or equal to
- `lt`: Less-than

```bash
Search().filter("range", number_of_questions={"gte": 10, "lte": 50})
```

For filter results where a field is equal to a specific numeric value, use the `term` operator:

```bash
Search().filter("term", number_of_questions=5)
```

## List Filtering

The `terms` operator is used to filter results where a specific value is in a list of values:

```bash
answers_list = ["David", "Michael", "Bob"]

Search().filter("terms", answers=answers_list)
```

## Boolean Filtering

The `term` operator can also be used for boolean filtering:

```bash
Search().filter("term", is_active=True)
```

## Exclusion Filtering

The `exclude` operator is a shortcut to the `must_not` boolean operator. The following query
returns all results where `answer` is not "Michael":

```bash
Search().exclude("term", answer="Michael")
```
