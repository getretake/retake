<Note>
  The code provided in this section and all subsequent sections is for query
  construction only. For a query to be executed, it must be passed into
  `Index.search`. See [Overview](/search/overview) for instructions.

## Basic Usage

The `query` function performs keyword (BM25) search. Use the `term` operator for exact matches
and the `match` operator for full-text queries. For instance, the `term` operator on "Who am I?" will
return documents containing the exact phrase "Who am I?", whereas the `match` operator will return
documents containing "Who", "am", or "I":

```python
Search().query("term", questions="Who am I?")
```

## Multiple Columns

The `multi_match` operator enables search for a term in multiple columns. This example searches
for matches in both the `question` and `answer` columns of a table:

```python
Search().query("multi_match", query="Who am I", fields=["question", "answer"])
```

## Fuzzy Matching

The `fuzzy` operator enables fuzzy search. The following query searches for matches for a query
and allows for up to two character changes:

```python
Search().query("fuzzy", questions={"value": "Whom I?", "fuzziness": 2})
```

## Boolean Queries

Boolean queries provide a flexible way to construct complex queries using four types of operators: `must`, `must_not`, `should`, and `filter`.

- `must`: The equivalent of logical AND, the `must` operator stipulates that all conditions within this clause must be satisfied for a document to match the query.

- `must_not`: The opposite of `must`, the `must_not` operator ensures that no conditions within this clause are present in any of the matching documents.

- `should`: Analogous to logical OR, the `should` operator specifies conditions that, if met, increase the relevance score of the matches. It's not mandatory for a document to meet should conditions to match the query, but it helps in scoring.

- `filter`: The filter `operator` works similar to `must` but doesn't affect the scoring. It simply includes/excludes documents based on whether they match the filter condition.

```python
from retakesearch import Q

Search().query(
    Q(
        "bool",
        must=[Q("match", questions="Who am I?")],
        filter=[Q("term", answer="Michael")],
        must_not=[Q("term", questions="Where are you?")],
        should=[Q("match", questions="Whom are you?")]
    )
)

```
