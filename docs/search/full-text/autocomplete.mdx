## Overview

Autocomplete, or regex search, enables users to obtain search results when only part of a word, phrase,
or pattern has been provided. This is especially useful for building search-as-you-type user interfaces.

<Note>
BM25 scoring and highlighting are not yet available for results returned by autocomplete.

## Basic Usage

Use the `paradedb.regex` query builder to pass a regex query to the `search` function.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.search(
	query => paradedb.regex(
		field => '<field>',
		pattern => '<pattern>'
	)
);
```
