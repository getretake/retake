title: BM25 Scoring
---

## Overview

BM25 scores measure how relevant a score is for a given query. Higher scores indicate higher relevance.

## Basic Usage

The `paradedb.rank_bm25` function creates a column that contains each row's BM25 score. It accepts a key
column as an argument, which usually is the primary key column of your table.

```sql
SELECT *, paradedb.rank_bm25(<key_field>)
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <table_name> @@@ '<query>'
```

<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
