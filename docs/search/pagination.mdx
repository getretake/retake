title: Pagination

## Basic Usage

Pagination and offsets can be applied using Python slicing. The below query retries ten results, starting
with the tenth result:

```bash
client.search(
    table_name,
    Search().query("match", question="Who am I?")[10:20]
)
```

## Deep Pagination

Python slicing is not highly efficient for deep pagination. For instance, when you request documents from 10 to 50,
Retake first computes the top 50 results, and then returns only the results from positions 10 to 50.

The `search_after` operator avoids the high memory cost of deep pagination. However, it requires that the sort order
remains consistent between pages and is unable to jump to a specific page â€” only the next page.

```bash
query = Search().query("match", question="Who am I?")[0:1000]

# First page
first_response = client.search(
    table_name,
    query
)

# Second page
search_after = first_response.hits[-1].meta.sort
second_response = client.search(
    table_name,
    query.extra(search_after=search_after)
)
```
