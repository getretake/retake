title: Custom DSL
---

The `from_dict` function can be used to execute queries using JSON DSL objects. This is useful if you are
familiar with the OpenSearch DSL and prefer to write more complex queries this way.

```bash
dsl = {'query': {'match': {'field': 'test'}}}

client.search(
    table_name,
    Search().from_dict(dsl)
)
```
