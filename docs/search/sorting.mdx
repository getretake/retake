## By Relevance

The response object of each search result contains a `_score` attribute. Higher scores represent results that
are more relevant to the search query. The `sort` function can be used to sort results by score in descending order:

```python
Search().query("term", questions="Who am I?").sort("_score")
```

## Custom Sorting

The `sort` function also accepts field names for custom sorting. Multiple criteria can be provided,
and the results will be sorted in order of the provided criteria.

```python
Search()
    .query("term", questions="Who am I?")
    .sort(
        "questions", # Ascending order
        "-answer" # Descending order
    )
```
