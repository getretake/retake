## What is a Sparse HNSW Index?

Generated by new models like SPLADE, sparse vectors can detect the presence of exact keywords while also capturing
semantic similarity between terms. Unlike dense vectors, sparse vectors contain significantly more entries, most of which
are zero. For instance, OpenAIâ€™s `text-embedding-ada-002` model outputs dense vectors with 1536 entries, whereas
SPLADE outputs sparse vectors with over 30,000 entries.

A sparse HNSW index is a specialized HNSW index designed to handle sparse vectors.

## Creating a Sparse HNSW Index

The following command creates a sparse HNSW index over a column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON <schema_name>.<table_name>
USING shnsw (<column_name> <distance_metric>);
```

<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema, or namespace, of the table. The schema name only needs
  to be provided if the table is not in the `public` schema.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="column_name" required>
  The name of the column being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance_metric" required>
  The distance metric used for measuring similarity between two vectors. Use
  `svector_l2_ops` for L2 distance, `svector_ip_ops` for inner product, and
  `svector_cosine_ops` for cosine distance.
</ParamField>

## Index Options

The following example demonstrates how to pass options when creating the HNSW index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON mock_items
USING shnsw (sparse_embedding svector_l2_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

<ParamField body="m" default={16}>
  The maximum number of connections per layer. A higher value increases recall
  but also increases index size and construction time.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ef_construction" default={64}>
  A higher value creates a higher quality graph, which increases recall but also
  construction time.
</ParamField>

## Deleting a Sparse HNSW Index

The following command deletes a sparse HNSW index:

```sql
DROP INDEX <index_name>;
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>

## Recreating a Sparse HNSW Index

A sparse HNSW index only needs to be recreated if the name of the indexed column changes.
To recreate the index, simply delete and create it using the SQL commands above.
