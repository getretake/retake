## What is HNSW?

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is an algorithm used for efficient approximate nearest neighbor
search in high-dimensional spaces. It constructs a multi-layered graph structure, where each layer is a
subset of the previous one, enabling faster navigation through the data points. This approach allows
HNSW to achieve state-of-the-art search speed and accuracy, especially for large-scale datasets.

ParadeDB uses the `pgvector` HNSW index, which offers a significant performance boost over the original
IVFFlat `pgvector` index.

## Creating a HNSW Index

The following command creates an HNSW index over a column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON <schema_name>.<table_name>
USING hnsw (<column_name> <distance_metric>);
```

<ParamField body="schema_name">
  The name of the schema, or namespace, of the table. The schema name only needs
  to be provided if the table is not in the `public` schema.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="column_name" required>
  The name of the column being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance_metric" required>
  The distance metric used for measuring similarity between two vectors. Use
  `vector_l2_ops` for L2 distance, `vector_ip_ops` for inner product, and
  `vector_cosine_ops` for cosine distance.
</ParamField>

## Index Options

The following example demonstrates how to pass options when creating the HNSW index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON mock_items
USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

<ParamField body="m" default={16}>
  The maximum number of connections per layer. A higher value increases recall
  but also increases index size and construction time.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ef_construction" default={64}>
  A higher value creates a higher quality graph, which increases recall but also
  construction time.
</ParamField>

## Deleting a HNSW Index

The following command deletes a HNSW index:

```sql
DROP INDEX <index_name>;
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>

## Recreating a HNSW Index

Like a BM25 index, an HNSW index only needs to be recreated if the name of the indexed column changes.
To recreate the index, simply delete and create it using the SQL commands above.

## Limitations

Stemming from [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#hnsw),
HNSW indexing supports vectors with a maximum dimensionality of 2,000.
Larger vectors are typically needed only for sparse data scenarios.
Addressing this, ParadeDB introduces [`pg_sparse`](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_sparse)
to facilitate efficient [sparse vector indexing](/search/indexing/sparse).
