title: BM25 Index
---

## What is BM25?

BM25, which stands for Best Matching 25, is the go-to choice for many modern search engines like ElasticSearch.
It ranks documents by considering how often a term appears and how unique that term is across all
documents. BM25 is especially useful when you need to find exact keywords or phrases within documents.

The BM25 index enables full text search over a table and relevance scoring using the BM25 algorithm.

## Creating a BM25 Index

The following command creates a BM25 index over a table along with a new schema containing query functions.
Once an index is created, it automatically stays in sync with the underlying table as the data changes.

```sql
paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => '<index_name>',
  table_name => '<table_name>',
  key_field => '<key_field>'
  text_fields => '<text_fields>',
  numeric_fields => '<numeric_fields>',
  boolean_fields => '<boolean_fields>',
  json_fields => '<json_fields>',
);
```

The `index_name` input will become the name of the new schema that is created. Querying that schema makes use
of an "object.method" syntax, with methods like `search`, `rank`, and `highlight`.

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
CALL paradedb.create_bm25(
  index_name => 'search_idx',
  table_name => 'mock_items',
  key_field => 'id',
  text_fields => '{
    description: {tokenizer: {type: "en_stem"}}, category: {}
  }'
);
```

After executing the example above, a new schema called `mock_items` will be created. You can search the `mock_items`
table with the BM25 index with the associated `search` function:

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.search('description:shoes');
```

</Accordion>

Each `_fields` input to `create_bm25()` accepts a [JSON5](https://json5.org)-formatted string. Keys don't need to be quoted, and trailing commas and comments are allowed. JSON5 is backwards-compatible, so standard JSON works too.

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index. The index name can be anything, as long as doesn't
  conflict with an existing index or schema. A new schema with associated query functions will be created with this name.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table being indexed.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="key_field" required>
  The name of a column in the table that represents a unique identifier for each record. Usually, this
  is the same column that is the primary key of table. Currently, only integer IDs are supported, so
  if necessary you may consider creating a dedicated column to use e.g: `ALTER TABLE mock_items ADD COLUMN bm25_id SERIAL`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="schema_name" default="CURRENT SCHEMA">

## Deleting a BM25 Index

The following command deletes a BM25 index, as well as its associated schema and query functions:

```sql
CALL paradedb.drop_bm25('<index_name>');
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
CALL paradedb.drop_bm25('mock_items');
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index you wish to delete.
</ParamField>

## Recreating a BM25 Index

A BM25 index only needs to be recreated if the underlying table schema changes â€” for instance, if a new
column is added or the name of a column changes. To recreate the index, simply delete the index and create
a new one using the commands provided above.

## Getting Info on a BM25 Index

The `schema` function returns a table with information about the index schema.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <index_name>.schema();
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

```sql
SELECT * FROM search_idx.schema();
```

</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>

## Tokenizers

<ParamField body="default">
  Chops the text on according to whitespace and punctuation, removes tokens that
  are too long, and converts to lowercase. Filters out tokens larger than 255
  bytes.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="raw">
  Does not process nor tokenize text. Filters out tokens larger than 255 bytes.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="en_stem">
  Like `default`, but also applies stemming on the resulting tokens. Filters out
  tokens larger than 255 bytes.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="whitespace">
  Tokenizes the text by splitting on whitespaces.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="ngram">
  Tokenizes text by splitting words into overlapping substrings based on the specified parameters:

`min_gram`: Defines the minimum length for the n-grams. For instance, if set to 2, the smallest token created would be of length 2 characters.

`max_gram`: Determines the maximum length of the n-grams. If set to 5, the largest token produced would be of length 5 characters.

`prefix_only`: When set to true, the tokenizer generates n-grams that start from the beginning of the word only, ensuring a prefix progression. If false, n-grams are created from all possible character combinations within the min_gram and max_gram range.
