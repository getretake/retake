## Overview

Autocomplete, or regex search, enables users to obtain search results when only part of a word, phrase,
or pattern has been provided. This is especially useful for building search-as-you-type user interfaces.

When using autocomplete, you should not include the field name in the search query.

<Note>
  BM25 scoring and highlighting are not yet available for results returned by
  autocomplete.

## Basic Usage

The `search` function comes with several parameters that can activate and configure autocomplete.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <index_name>.search(
  '<query>',
  regex_fields = '<regex_fields>'
);
```
