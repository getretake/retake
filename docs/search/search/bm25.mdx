title: Basic Full Text Search
---

<Note>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](/latest/indexing/bm25).
</Note>

## Overview

Full text search uses the [BM25 index](/latest/indexing/bm25) to find rows in a table that match a query.
This type of search is especially useful for matching keywords inside documents.

## Basic Usage

The `search` function returns rows of a table that match a search query. By default, rows are sorted by relevance.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <index_name>.search('<query>');
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string. See the query options below for how to construct this
  string.
</ParamField>

## ParadeQL

The query string accepts ParadeQL, a mini query language which can be used to construct more expressive queries.

### Specifying Fields

Each query must specify which field to search over. In the following example, we are querying for
"keyboard" against the "description" field.

```sql
'description:keyboard'
```

### Phrase Search

Phrases containing spaces should be wrapped in double quotes.

```sql
'description:"plastic keyboard"'
```

### Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator is used to match phrases separated by words in between. For instance, let's say
there exists a row with `description` set to "ergonomic metal keyboard." Because words "ergonomic" and "keyboard"
are separated by one word, the following query would find this row.

```sql
'"ergonomic keyboard"~1'
```

<Note>
  The slop operator is distinct from [fuzzy search](/search/fuzzy), which is
  used for typo tolerance.
</Note>

### Efficient Filtering

Filters can be applied over numeric fields, which improves query times compared to standard SQL `WHERE` clauses.

```sql
-- Equality
'description:keyboard AND rating:4'

-- Simple range
'description:keyboard AND rating:>4'

-- Inclusive range
'description:keyboard AND rating:[2 TO 5]'

-- Exclusive range
'description:keyboard AND rating:{2 TO 5}'

-- Boolean
'description:keyboard AND is_available:false'
```

<Note>
  Filters only work over Postgres columns that have been indexed as
  [`numeric_fields`](/indexing/bm25#creating-a-bm25-index) or
  [`boolean_fields`](/indexing/bm25#creating-a-bm25-index).
</Note>

### JSON Fields

Use `.` to search over text values nested inside JSON. For instance, the following query would search
over a field with values like `{"metadata": {"color": "white"}}`.

```sql
'metadata.color:white'
```

<Note>
  JSON search only works over `json` and `jsonb` Postgres columns that have been
  indexed as [`json_fields`](/indexing/bm25#creating-a-bm25-index).
</Note>

### Boosting

The `^` character is used to boost the scores of individual fields. Boosting is helpful for tuning
the relevance scores of results.

```sql
'description:keyboard^2 OR category:electronics^3'
```

### Boolean Operators

`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
'description:keyboard OR category:toy'
```

Use parentheses to group terms and control the order of operations.

```sql
'(description:keyboard OR category:toy) AND description:metal'
```

### Set Operator

The set operator is a more CPU-efficient way of combining multiple `OR`s.

```sql
'description:IN [keyboard, toy]'
```

### Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, ```, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE`must be escaped by a`\` inside the query term.

## Limit and Offset

Specifying a limit and offset is a more efficient way of iterating through search results compared to
SQL's `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` options. For optimal query performance, we recommend using the `limit_rows` and
`offset_rows` options instead of `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <index_name>.search(
  '<query>',
  limit_rows => <limit_rows>,
  offset_rows => <offset_rows>
)
```

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="limit_rows">The maximum number of rows to return.</ParamField>
<ParamField body="offset_rows">
  The number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.
</ParamField>
