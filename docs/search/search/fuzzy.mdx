title: Fuzzy Search
---

## Overview

Fuzzy search allows users to obtain search results that approximately match the query term,
accommodating minor typos in the input. This enhances the search experience by
providing relevant results even when the query is not spelled correctly.

<Note>Highlighting is not currently supported for fuzzy search queries.</Note>

## Basic Usage

The `search` function comes with several parameters that can activate and configure fuzzy search.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <index_name>.search(
  '<query>',
  fuzzy_fields => '<fuzzy_fields>',
  distance => <distance>,
  transpose_cost_one => <transpose_cost_one>,
  prefix => <prefix>
);
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">
  ```sql SELECT * FROM search_idx.search( 'description:keybroadd', fuzzy_fields
  => 'description,category' ); ```
</Accordion>

<ParamField body="index_name" required>
  The name of the index.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="fuzzy_fields" required>
  A comma-separated string list of column names to perform fuzzy search over.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance" default={2}>
  The maximum Levenshtein distance (i.e. single character edits) allowed to
  consider a term in the index as a match for the query term. Maximum value is
  `2`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="transpose_cost_one" default={true}>
  When set to `true`, transpositions (swapping two adjacent characters) as a
  single edit in the Levenshtein distance calculation, while `false` considers
  it two separate edits (a deletion and an insertion).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prefix" default={true}>
  When set to `true`, the initial substring (prefix) of the query term is
  exempted from the fuzzy edit distance calculation, while false includes the
  entire string in the calculation.
</ParamField>
