title: Aggregation
---

Aggregation, also known as faceting, enables developers to gather statistics about search results,
enabling the analysis of patterns in the dataset at scale. The `aggs` function, in conjunction with
the `A` helper, is used to add aggregations to any search query.

### Basic Usage

```python
from retakesearch import A

bucket_name = "average_price"
agg = A("avg", field="price")

response = index.search(
    Search().aggs.metrics(bucket_name, agg)
)

# Print the average price
print(response.aggregations[bucket_name].value)
```

## Operators

### Distinct Values

`terms` groups results by distinct values. Each unique value becomes a bucket.

```python
A('terms', field='color')
```

### Range

`range` groups results into range buckets. For numerical data, these ranges could be something like
"1-10", "10-20", "20-30", etc.

```python
A('range', field='price', ranges=[{'from': 10, 'to': 20}, {'from': 20, 'to': 30}])
```

### Date Range

`date_range` functions similarly to `range` but works with date fields.

```python
A('date_range', field='publish_date', ranges=[{'from': 'now-1d/d', 'to': 'now/d'}, {'from': 'now-1M/M', 'to': 'now/M'}])
```

### Histogram

`histogram` groups numbers into buckets of equal width.

```python
A('histogram', field='price', interval=10)
```

### Date Histogram

`date_histogram` is a special form of histogram that works with date fields.

```python
A('date_histogram', field='publish_date', interval='month')
```

### Average

`avg` calculates the average of a field.

```python
A('avg', field='price')
```

### Sum

`sum` calculates the sum of a field.

```python
A('sum', field='quantity')
```

### Min and Max

`min` and `max` calculate the min and max of a field, respectively.

```python
A('min', field='price')
```
