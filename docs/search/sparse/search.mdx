title: Sparse Vector Search
---

## Basic Usage

<Note>
  Creating a [sparse HNSW index](/search/sparse/index) over a table can
  significantly improve query times.
</Note>

Sparse vectors can be searched using L2 distance, cosine distance, or inner product.

```sql
-- L2 distance
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <-> '[1,2,3]'::svector;

-- Cosine distance
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <=> '[1,2,3]'::svector;

-- Inner product
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY sparse_embedding <#> '[1,2,3]'::svector;
```

Under the hood, ParadeDB uses `pg_sparse` for sparse vector search, which is ParadeDB's fork of `pgvector`.
Please refer to the [`pg_sparse` documentation](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_sparse) for more details.
