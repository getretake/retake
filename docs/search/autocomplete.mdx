## Overview

Autocomplete, or regex search, enables users to obtain search results when only part of a word, phrase,
or pattern has been provided. This is especially useful for building search-as-you-type user interfaces.

When using regex search, you should not include the field name in the search query.

## Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <table_name> @@@ '<query>:::<regex_field_options>'
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">

  'key:::regex_fields=description,category' ```
