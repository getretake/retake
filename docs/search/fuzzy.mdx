title: Fuzzy Search
---

## Overview

Fuzzy search allows users to obtain search results that approximately match the query term,
accommodating minor typos, spelling errors, or variations in the input. This enhances the search experience by
providing relevant results even when the query is not spelled exactly.

## Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <table_name> @@@ '<query>:::<fuzzy_field_options>'
```

<Accordion title="Example Usage">
  ```sql SELECT * FROM mock_items WHERE mock_items @@@
  'description:keybroadd:::fuzzy_fields=description,category' ```
</Accordion>

<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="fuzzy_field_options" required>
  Fuzzy field config options.
  <Expandable title="Config Options">
    <ParamField body="fuzzy_fields" required>
      A comma-separated string list of column names to perform fuzzy search
      over.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="distance" default={2}>
      The maximum Levenshtein distance (i.e. single character edits) allowed to
      consider a term in the index as a match for the query term. Maximum value
      is `2`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="transpose_cost_one" default={true}>
      When set to `true`, transpositions (swapping two adjacent characters) as a
      single edit in the Levenshtein distance calculation, while `false`
      considers it two separate edits (a deletion and an insertion).
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="prefix" default={true}>
      When set to `true`, the initial substring (prefix) of the query term is
      exempted from the fuzzy edit distance calculation, while false includes
      the entire string in the calculation.
    </ParamField>
