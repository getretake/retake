title: Basic Full Text Search
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a table, it must
  first be [indexed](indexing/bm25).
</Info>

## Overview

Full text search uses the [BM25 index](/indexing/bm25) to find rows in a table that match a query.
This type of search is especially useful for matching keywords inside documents.

## Basic Usage

The custom `@@@` operator signifies a full text search. The left-hand side of the `@@@` accepts the
name of the table, and the right-hand side accepts the query.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <table_name> @@@ '<query>'
```

<ParamField body="table_name" required>
  The name of the table.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="query" required>
  The query string. See the query options below for how to construct this
  string.
</ParamField>

## Mini Query Language

The query string accepts a mini query language which can be used to construct more expressive queries.

### Specifying Fields

If your table has multiple text fields, you can specify which field to search.

```sql
'description:keyboard'
```

### Phrases

Phrases should be wrapped in double quotes.

```sql
'"metal keyboard"'
```

### JSON Fields

Use `.` to search over text values nested inside JSON. For instance, the following query would search
over a field with values like `{"metadata": {"color": "white"}}`.

```sql
'metadata.color:white'
```

Note that JSON search only works over `json` and `jsonb` Postgres columns that have been indexed as
[`json_fields`](/indexing/bm25#creating-a-bm25-index).

### Boosting

The `^` character is used to boost the scores of individual fields. Boosting is helpful for tuning
the relevance scores of results.

```sql
'description:keyboard^2 OR category:electronics^3'
```

### Boolean Operators

`AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` can be used to combine and filter multiple terms.

```sql
'keyboard OR toy NOT metal'
```

Use parentheses to group terms and control the order of operations.

```sql
'(keyboard OR toy) AND metal'
```

### Set Operator

The set operator is a more CPU-efficient way of combining multiple `OR`s.

```sql
'description:IN [keyboard, toy]'
```

### Slop Operator

The `~` slop operator is used to match phrases separated by words in between. For instance, let's say
there exists a row with `description` set to "ergonomic metal keyboard." Because words "ergonomic" and "keyboard"
are separated by one word, the following query would find this row.

```sql
'"ergonomic keyboard"~1'
```

Note that the slop operator is distinct from [fuzzy search](/search/fuzzy).

### Special Characters

The special characters `+` , `^`, ```, `:`, `{`, `}`, `"`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `~`, `!`, `\\`, `\*`, and `SPACE`
must be escaped by a \ inside the query term.

## Configuration Options

A trailing `:::` at the end of a query string marks the beginning of a config string, which uses standard
URL param syntax. Individual options are separated by `&` and set with `=`.

### Limit and Offset

Specifying a limit and offset is a more efficient way of iterating through search results compared to
SQL's `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` options.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard:::limit=100&offset=50'
```

## Filtering

The standard SQL `WHERE` clause is used perform range and filter queries:

### Numeric

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mock_items
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
AND rating>=3;
```

### Timestamp

```sql
SELECT *
FROM your_table
WHERE mock_items @@@ 'keyboard'
WHERE purchase_date > '2023-01-01 12:00:00-05';
```
