title: Basic Similarity Search

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Before performing full text search over a column, it should
  first be [indexed](indexing/hnsw).

## Overview

Similarity search uses the HNSW algorithm to find rows in a table that match a given vector.
This type of search is especially useful for fuzzy or semantic search.

## Real-Time Vectorization

The `paradedb.embed` function is a helpful shortcut that vectorizes any column using any HuggingFace
embedding model. To vectorize a column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items
ADD COLUMN embeddings vector(384)
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (paradedb.embed('all-minilm-l6-v2', description)) STORED;
```

Columns can be combined before vectorization:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mock_items
ADD COLUMN embeddings vector(384)
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (paradedb.embed('all-minilm-l6-v2', description || ' ' || category)) STORED;
```

The `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` command ensures that vectors are updated in real time whenever the underlying
columns change.

## Similarity Search

You can search with a raw vector:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY embeddings <-> '[3,1,2]'
```

or with a query string:

```sql
WITH query AS (
    SELECT paradedb.embed('all-minilm-l6-v2', 'My query string')::vector AS embedding
)
SELECT description, category, rating
FROM mock_items, query
ORDER BY mock_items.embeddings <-> query.embedding;
```

Under the hood, ParadeDB uses `pgvector` for similarity search. Please refer to the
[`pgvector` documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for more detailed documentation.
