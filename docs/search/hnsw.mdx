title: Basic Similarity Search
---

<Note>
  Creating an [HNSW index](indexing/hnsw) over a table can significantly improve
  query times.
</Note>

## Overview

Similarity search uses the HNSW algorithm to find rows in a table that match a given vector.
This type of search is especially useful for semantic search.

## Basic Usage

The following example returns rows sorted by L2 distance with respect to the query vector.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mock_items ORDER BY embedding <-> '[1,2,3]';
```

Under the hood, ParadeDB uses `pgvector` for similarity search. Please refer to the
[`pgvector` documentation](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for more detailed documentation.
