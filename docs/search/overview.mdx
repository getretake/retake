To execute a search query, you must use the `Index.search` function and
pass in the search query, written using the `Search` high-level Python client.

## Basic Usage

This example performs a keyword search for all rows in the Postgres table `faqs` where
the column `question` matches the phrase "Who Am I?".

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Client, Search

client = Client(
  api_key="retake-test-key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Use client.create_index if the index doesn't exist
index = client.get_index("my_index")

# Construct query
query = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")

# Execute query
response = index.search(query)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Client, Search } from "retake-search";
import { matchQuery } from "retake-search/helpers";

const client = new Client("retake-test-key", "http://localhost:8000");

// Use client.createIndex if the index doesn't exist
const index = client.getIndex("my_index");

// Construct query
const query = Search().query(matchQuery("questions", "Who am I?"));

// Execute query
const response = index.search(query);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Query Construction

Complex search logic like filters, ranking, faceting, pagination, etc. can be added to the `Search` class
as a logical pipeline of transformations. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
query = (
    Search()
    .query("match", questions="Who am I?")
    .filter("term", answers="Michael")
    .sort("-answers")
)

response = index.search(query)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { matchQuery, termQuery, sort } from "retake-search/helpers"

const query = Search()
  .boolQuery()
  .must(matchQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
  .filter(termQuery("answers", "Michael))
  .sort(sort("answers", "desc"))
```

</CodeGroup>

The following sections will cover the specifics of how to write different types of queries. Please note
that this is guide is non-exhaustive, and that many more features of the `Search` client can be found
