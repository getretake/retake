  up Retake](/quickstart).

To execute a search query, you must use the `Client.search` function and specify

1. The name of the table that you want to search
2. The search query, written using the `Search` high-level Python client

## Basic Usage

```bash
from retakesearch import Client, Search

client = Client(
  api_key="retake_test_key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

table_name = "faqs"
response = client.search(
    table_name,
    Search().query("match", question="Who am I?")
)
```

The above example performs a keyword search for all rows in the Postgres table `faqs` where
the column `question` matches the phrase "Who Am I?". Note that the table `faqs` and column
`question` [must first be indexed](/quickstart) prior to query execution.

## More Complex Example

Complex search logic like filters, ranking, pagination, etc. can be added to the `Search` class
as chained functions. For example, the following query performs a filter on the above query:

```bash
response = client.search(
    table_name,
    Search()
        .query("match", question="Who am I?")
        .filter("term", answer="Michael")
)
```

The following sections will cover the specifics of how to write different types of queries.
