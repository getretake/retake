To execute a search query, you must use the `Index.search` function and
pass in the search query, written using the `Search` high-level Python client.

## Basic Usage

```python
from retakesearch import Client, Search

client = Client(
  api_key="retake-test-key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Use client.create_index if the index doesn't exist
index = client.get_index("my_index")

# Construct query
query = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")

# Execute query
response = index.search(query)
```

The above example performs a keyword search for all rows in the Postgres table `faqs` where
the column `question` matches the phrase "Who Am I?".

## More Complex Example

Complex search logic like filters, ranking, faceting, pagination, etc. can be added to the `Search` class
as a logical pipeline of transformations. For example:

```python
query = (
    Search()
    .query("match", questions="Who am I?")
    .filter("term", answer="Michael")
    .sort("-answer")
)

response = index.search(query)
```

The following sections will cover the specifics of how to write different types of queries. Please note
that this is guide is non-exhaustive, and that many more features of the `Search` client can be found
[in the source repository](https://github.com/getretake/opensearch-py).
