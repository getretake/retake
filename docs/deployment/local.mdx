<Warning>
  Currently, only Postgres-to-ElasticSearch real-time data streams are
  supported. The Retake team is actively adding support for other streams. [Join
  the waitlist](https://retake.typeform.com/to/JTcYtLay) to be notified when
  it's ready.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your computer.
- Your source must be properly configred. Refer to the [Setup](/deployment/setup) page for configuration details.

## Instructions

1. Clone the Retake repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getretake/retake.git
```

2. `cd` into the newly-cloned directory and start Docker Compose:

```bash
cd retake && docker compose up
```

If the containers start successfully, should see the following logs:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                     NAMES                      COMMAND                   CREATED         STATUS                            PORTS

187fa47011ae   bitnami/kafka:3.5                         retake-kafka-1             "/opt/bitnami/script…"    6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes                      9092/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9094->9094/tcp, :::9094->9094/tcp
```

3. Confirm the `retake-consumer` has successfully created the config topics:

```bash
docker compose logs consumer
```

You should see the following logs:

```bash
retake-consumer-1  | Topic _connector_config created
retake-consumer-1  | Topic _config_success created
```

4. That's it - the real-time server is now running and ready to receive requests! [Use the SDK](/quickstart/real-time-update) to connect
   to the server and configure real-time-updates.

<Note>
  If the source and sink servers are running as Docker containers in the same machine, you need to connect them to the Docker
  Compose network so they are accessible by the real-time server. This can be done with the `docker network connect <network> <container>`
  command. See the [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_connect/) for more information.
