<Info>**Prerequisite** Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.</Info>
<Warning>
  We are currently working on deploying to Docker hub and providing a Docker
  Compose file. This is a temporary installation workaround.
</Warning>

Clone the `retake` repository and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This spins up the Retake engine, which is responsible for executing search queries and storing search data.
