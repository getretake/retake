Depending on your source, you may need to make some configuration changes so that Retake can read data from your source.
Please find your source below and follow the setup instructions.

## Postgres

### Non-AWS

1. Ensure Postgres database user is a superuser

```
SELECT usename FROM pg_user WHERE usesuper = true
```

2. Enable logical decoding in postgres.conf

```
wal_level = logical
```

3. Ensure there is at least one replication slot defined in postgres.conf

```
max_replication_slots = 1
```

### AWS

Enable logical replication by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html).

## Other Sources

Right now, Retake is in beta and only supports Postgres sources. Other sources are coming soon. Please see the [roadmap](/company/roadmap)
for upcoming sources.
