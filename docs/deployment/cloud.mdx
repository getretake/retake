title: On a Cloud Instance
---

Retake can be self-hosted inside your own cloud. This is especially useful for applications with sensitive data,
as it ensures that the information remains within your cloud infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

1. You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine
2. Your instance has at least 8GB RAM

## Deployment

SSH into your instance and run:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getretake/retake/main/deploy.sh
```

This will download the deploy script. Next, run the deploy script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The deploy script will guide you through the process of configuring and running Retake.
