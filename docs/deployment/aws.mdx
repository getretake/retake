title: "On a Cloud Instance"
---

<Warning>
  Self-hosted cloud deployment is still under development. [Join the
  waitlist](https://retake.typeform.com/to/JTcYtLay) to be notified when it's
  production ready.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- The real-time server should be deployed on a computer with at least 4GB memory.
- The computer must expose an external port for Kafka. See
  `docker-compose.yaml` file for the recommended configuration.

### Instructions

1. SSH into your cloud instance.

2. Run the deploy script. It will use the `main` branch by default, but you
   can configure this with the `--branch` option. This will clone the repo,
   install the necessary dependencies, and spin up the real-time server inside a
   Docker container.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getretake/retake/main/deploy.sh | bash
```
