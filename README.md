[![Publishing](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/actions/workflows/publish-paradedb-to-dockerhub.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/actions/workflows/publish-paradedb-to-dockerhub.yml)

[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is an ElasticSearch alternative built on PostgreSQL,
engineered for lightning-fast full text, similarity, and hybrid search.

It offers the most comprehensive, Postgres-native search features of any Postgres
database, so you don't need to glue cumbersome services like a search engine or
vector database on top.

## Key Benefits

- ‚ö° **Speed**: ParadeDB is built in Rust on top of PostgreSQL and Tantivy,
  a Rust-based implementation of Apache Lucene.

- üåø **Simplicity**: Consolidate your database and search engine
  into a single system, so you don't need to worry about keeping separate services
  in sync.

- üêò **SQL First**: Write search queries in SQL with ACID transactions.

- üöÄ **Scalability**: Scale to millions of rows with support for distributed
  search, high availability, backups, and point-in-time-recovery (coming soon!).

## Status

ParadeDB is still under active development and is not yet ready to use
in production. We're aiming to be ready by the end of September 2023.

We are currently in Private Beta. Star & watch this repo to get notified of
major updates.

## Installation

### ParadeDB Cloud

Coming soon! Sign up for the [ParadeDB Cloud waitlist](https://paradedb.typeform.com/to/jHkLmIzx).

### Self-Hosted

To install ParadeDB locally or on-premise, simply pull and run the latest Docker
image:

```bash
docker run \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=<dbname> \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  paradedb/paradedb:latest
```

By default, this will start the ParadeDB database at `http://localhost:5432`. Use
`psql` to connect:

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -U <user> -d <dbname> -p 5432 -W
```

To install the ParadeDB extension(s) manually within an existing self-hosted Postgres,
see the extension(s)' README. We strongly recommend using the ParadeDB Docker image,
which is optimized for running search in Postgres. If you're self-hosting Postgres
and are interested in ParadeDB, please [contact the ParadeDB team](mailto:hello@paradedb.com)
and we'll be happy to help!
