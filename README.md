## Key Features

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Out-of-the-Box Data Sync

Existing vector stores are siloes that require complex and sometimes brittle mechanisms for data synchronization.
Retake provides the missing connectors that allow seamless data synchronization without the need for extensive
configuration or third-party tools.

### :rocket: True Real-Time Updates

Retake's connectors achieve sub-10ms end-to-end data latency, excluding variable model inference times.

### :link: Extensible Python SDK

You can configure any source, sink, transformation, and embedding model as code. Joining and filtering tables
or adding metadata is easily done from Python functions.

### :zap: Scalable and Efficient

Built on top of Kafka, Retake is designed to handle large volumes of data and high-throughput workloads.

### :globe_with_meridians: Deployable Anywhere

You can run Retake anywhere, from your laptop to a distributed cloud system.
