## Why Retake
- **Out-of-the-box data sync** Existing embeddings databases are data siloes that require complex and sometimes brittle mechanisms for data synchronization. Retake provides the missing connectors that allow seamless data synchronization without the need for extensive configuration or third-party tools.
- **True real-time updates** Retake's connectors achieve sub-10ms end-to-end data latency, excluding variable model inference times.
- **Dead-simple Python SDK**  With just a few lines of Python code, you can set up data synchronization, query embeddings, and perform sophisticated transformations.
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Designed to handle large volumes of data and high-throughput workloads.
